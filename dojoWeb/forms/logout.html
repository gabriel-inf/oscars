    <p>Basic OSCARS functionality is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Clicking on the Reservations tab will bring up a tree listing all
    selected reservations.  Expanding an item in that tree will bring up
    a reservation's details.
    </li>
    <li>
    Clicking on the Create Reservation tab will bring up a form to create a
    reservation.
    </li>
    <li>
    Clicking on the Users tab brings up a tree of OSCARS user-related
    information.
    Expanding a particular user from that list brings up that user's details.
    You currently need OSCARS admin privileges to view other users' information.
    </li>
    </ul>
