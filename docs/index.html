<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With the advent of service sensitive applications (such as remote-
controlled experiments, time constrained massive data transfers,
video-conferencing, etc.), it has become apparent that there is a need
to augment the services present in today's
<a href="http://www.es.net/">Energy Sciences Network</a> (ESnet)
infrastructure. The On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance
Reservation System (OSCARS) project prototypes one such new service:
dynamically provisioned, guaranteed bandwidth secure circuits both
within ESnet, and between ESnet and other network domains.</p>
<p>OSCARS is funded out of the DOE Office of Science. The official
<a href="http://www.es.net/OSCARS/">project</a> page has links to the
original proposal, a project summary, and presentations on OSCARS.
Based on the original proposal, <a href="specs/fspec.html">functional</a>
and <a href="specs/dspec.html">design</a> specifications were written
to formalize the plans for the implementation. The original
implementation
was based on the Internet2
<a href="https://discvenue.internet2.edu/athena/">BRUW</a> project.
Since
then, the two projects have merged and share a common code base.</p>
<p>A <a href="papers/gridnets.pdf">GridNets 2006 paper</a> goes into
the details of OSCARS as of August 2006.</p>
<p>A number of <a href="developers.html">developers</a> have
contributed
to OSCARS, including personnel from ESnet and Internet2.</p>
<p>Planned improvements for OSCARS 0.6 (approximately middle of April)
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>improved browser interface using Dojo and JSON, and</li>
  <li>multi-phase database commits for interdomain reservations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OSCARS Components</h2>
<p>The specifications listed above go into the details of each
component
of OSCARS. Note that the Pathfinder and Interdomain components listed
below were originally part of the BSS component.</p>
<p>Following are notes on each component's usage in practice:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="notes/bss.html">BSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="notes/pathfinder.html">Pathfinder</a></li>
  <li><a href="notes/interdomain.html">Interdomain</a> component</li>
  <li><a href="notes/pss.html">PSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="notes/aaa.html">AAA</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="api/index.html">javadocs</a> cover the programmatic
usage
of the classes in each component.</p>
<p><a href="notes/exampleClients.html">Example clients</a> are provided
as part of the distribution.</p>
<h2>OSCARS Dependencies</h2>
<p>An effort was made to keep OSCARS's dependencies on other
applications
to a minimum. The following are notes on the packages we use:</p>
<p>All persistence of reservation and other data is handled using
<a href="notes/hibernate.html">Hibernate 3.2</a>.
Hibernate is a powerful object-relational mapping system for Java, but
has a
learning curve.
</p>
<p>The server portion of OSCARS currently depends on being deployed
under Tomcat 5.5 for the browser-based
interface. The API-based interface depends on being deployed under
Axis2.1. with
rampart 1.1 running under Tomcat 5.5.
See <a href="notes/tomcat.html">configuration notes for Tomcat, Axis2
and OSCARS</a> for
details of the configrations we use and <a href="notes/axis2.html">Axis2.1
installation notes</a>
for how to build and install Axis2.1.1.1 with Rampart1.1. Axis 2.1 is
the standard Java SOAP implementation.
We use <a href="http://hadleynet.org/marc/whatsnew.html#S1">SOAP 1.2</a>
messages for communication, rather than 1.1,
because of an incompatibility between Axis2-Rampart1.1 and SOAP fault
handling for SOAP 1.1. The client side code generated by Axis2/Rampart
does
not print out SOAP 1.1 Fault messages. (This has reportably been fixed
as of March 2007)</p>
<p>For security reasons, all SOAP messages are signed. To accomplish
this, several keystores and configuration files need to be <a
 href="notes/keystore.html">set up</a>.</p>
