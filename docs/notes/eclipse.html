To create a new Java project with the sources checked out from  the repository 
File ->  new -> other -> SVN check out project
     select repository location https://oscars.es.net/repos/oscars/branches
check out as project to be configured by project wizard
Project wizard lets you pick a project name
  source files and build files can be chosen later using the project->properties-> build path
`
  Java Project, Set Java VM (1.5)
    separate src and build directories
       rename the bin dir to build

Add libraries:
  project -> properties -> java build path -> Libaries ->  add library
    user library ->  new -> name, system library, add jars 

run axis2 WSDL2Java  - <i>There is an ant task for this in build.xml which we now use</i>
file -> new ->other -> Axis2Wizards Axis2 Code Generator
   select wsdl file, ->  next
   chose server-side, client-side, skeleton, default services.xml
    generate sync style only
    set the package name to net.es.oscars.oscars 
   -> next  select the project for the generated code - net.es.net.oscars.wsdlTypes
  -> finish  generating code
NB: this does not regenerate the OSCARSSkeleton.java,
	OSCARSMessageReceiverInOut, OSCARSStub,OSCARSSkeletonInterface.java 
    or the resources/OSCARS.wsdl, services.xml
  if any of these files already exist. 

Tried data binding none and xmlbeans
   Only creates four files: Skeleton, service stub MessageReceiverInOut
   Uses org.apache.axion.om.OMElement classes for the params.
   xmlbeans gives three times as many classes foo, fooImpl, fooDocument, 
   fooDocumentImpl
