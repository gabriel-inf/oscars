<h1>Pathfinder component notes</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The pathfinder component deals with 
.</p>
<p> Currently OSCARS implements the following pathfinding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overlay Pathfinder</li>
<li>TERCE pathfinding</li>
<li>Traceroute-based pathfinding</li>
<li>Topology database database graph pathfinding</li>
</ul>
<p>The OSCARS administrator can choose which method of pathfinding 
they want to use at configuration time.</p>
<p>Moreover, OSCARS developers with different needs may develop their 
own pathfinder implementation by creating a new class that implements 
the Pathfinder java interface.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Overlay Pathfinder</h3>
<p>This pathfinding method is the most trivial one, and relies on the user
providing the complete ERO. It will simply map the user-provided path 
elements in the reservation request to local database pathElem entries.</p>
<h3>TERCE Pathfinder</h3>
<p>This pathfinder will use the TERCE pathfinding web service to
find a path from the ingress to the egress. See the TERCE documentation
for more details.</p>
<h3>Traceroute Pathfinder</h3>
<p>Traceroute pathfinding will use IP traceroute from the ingress to the 
egress to do pathfinding. It is most useful when the policy for path 
creation between any two points in the network coicides with the
IP routing policy.</p>
<h3>Topology database graph Pathfinder</h3>
<p>This method will try to find the least-cost path from the ingress to
the egress. It is still under development, and relies on the domain
administrator having assigned a cost to the various links in the 
topology database.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The admin must choose which pathfinder class they want to run by configuring the 
OSCARS server through oscars.properties. The relevant property is 
pathfinder.pathMethod. Valid values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>terce</b> to use TERCE</li>
<li><b>traceroute</b> for traceroute</li>
<li><b>overlay</b> for the overlay pathfinder</li>
<li><b>dbgraph</b> for the database-generated graph  pathfinder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>To develop a new Pathfinder method, the developer should implement the 
net.es.oscars.pathfinder.Pathfinder interface in their own class.
Then a short name for the method must be chosen, and PathfinderFactory must 
be modified to load the appropriate class when the pathfinder.pathMethod 
property has that value. </p>
