<h1>TSS component notes</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The TSS component deals with network topology database exchange 
between interdomain controllers. IDCs need to exchange topology
information to facilitate interdomain pathfinding. The TSS subsystem
is responsible for passing out local topology information, and for
importing topology information from other IDCs.</p>
<p> Currently OSCARS supports these operations on two different 
implementations of the topology database:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local SQL/Hibernate topology DB</li>
<li>Remote topology web service (TERCE)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OSCARS administrator can choose which method of topology exchange 
database (TEDB) they want to use at configuration time.</p>
<p>Moreover, OSCARS developers with different needs may develop their 
own TEDB implementation by creating a new class that implements 
the TEDB java interface.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The admin must choose which TEDB method they want to run by configuring the 
OSCARS server through oscars.properties. The relevant property is 
tedb.tedbMethod. Valid values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>terce</b> for the interface to TERCE</li>
<li><b>oscars</b> for the local Hibernate DB</li>
</ul>

<p>In both those cases the administrator must initialize the topology 
database accordingly. </p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>To develop a new TEDB method, the developer should implement the 
net.es.oscars.tss.TEDB interface. Then a short name for the method must 
be chosen (in addition to "oscars" and "terce"), and TEDBFactory must 
be modified to load the appropriate class when the tedb.tedbMethod 
property has that value. </p>
