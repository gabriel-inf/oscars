<h3>Setting up the example clients</h3>

<p>Assume the OSCARS source tree is checked out in $OSCARS_HOME. "OH" for 
short.</p>

<p>Running ant in OH/examples/javaClients will build all the client-side
classes and populate ./repo in that directory with
sec-client.{properties,jks} and axis2.xml.  The properties file has the
name and password for the keystore (sec-client.jks) and the keystore has the
certs for the ESnet Root CA, the DOEGrids CA, the OASIS interop CA and the
cert/key for "alice" and "bob".  alice is known to OSCARS on oscars-dev and
can list, cancel, query her own reservations and make a new reservation.
(These permisions seem a bit generous and will probably be limited in the
future.)</p>

<p>The other client configuration file is ./repo/axis2.xml. This tells the
code to sign and timestamp the outgoing message and to expect timestamps on
the replies. It also says what user to run as, which is currently set to
alice.</p>

<p>These files were copied from OH/conf/public/conf/client. You can override
these files by placing your own versions (e.g. with your user name/key) in
OH/conf/private/conf/client.</p>

<p>Use the shell scripts to run the client programs. These will set the
classpath first, and then run java with the right switches.</p>

<p>At this point, query, list, and cancel all work. CreateReservation wants
to look at a test.properties file that is in conf/private/server/topology.
I'm guessing that you do not have permission to check out that file.  It
provides default values for the parameters.  David and I are trying to
decide how to deal with this. The only issue seems to be the src and
destination host and router names.</p>

<h3>Handling the keystore</h3>

<p>The keytool command will do most of what you need:  listing contents,
setting aliases, adding  new trust certificates. The one think it does not
do is to import a trusted entry, e.g. cert and key.  There is a class that
comes with the jetty release that we have used. There may be tools in the
Sun suite as well.

<h4>input a pkcs12 file to a key store</h4>
<pre>

#NOTE:
# Need both the cert and private key in the keystore so...
# need to be in pem format so if it in DER format
openssl x509 -in mycert.der -inform DER -outform PEM -out mycert.pem

#use openssl to make ONE pkcs12 file (combine both cert & private key)
openssl pkcs12 -inkey jason.key.pem -in jason.cert.pem  -export -out foo.pkcs12

# use jetty to load it (from http://jetty.mortbay.org/)
/opt/java/j2re1.4.2_08/bin/java -cp `pwd`/lib/org.mortbay.jetty.jar org.mortbay.util.PKCS12Import /home/portnoy/u2/jason/De
sktop/keystore/foo.pkcs12 keystore.all.jks

</pre>

<p>Now to rename the alias use:</p>

<pre>
keytool -keyclone -alias 1 -dest mrt -keystore sec-client.jks
keytool -delete -alias 1 -keystore sec-client.jks
</pre>

<p>Then to import the DOEGrids CA cert:</p>

<pre>
keytool -import -keystore sec-client.jks -file ~mrt/certs/doeGridsCA.pem -trustcacerts -alias DOEGridsCA
keytool -import -keystore sec-client.jks -file ~mrt/certs/esnetRoot.pem -trustcacerts -alias esnetRoot
</pre>
