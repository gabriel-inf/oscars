Create Project 
File ->  new -> other -> SVN check out project
     select repository location https://oscars-test.es.net/repos/oscars/branches
check out as project to be configured by project wizard
Project wizard lets you pick a project name
  source files and build files can be chosen later using the project->properties-> build path
`
  Java Project, Set Java VM (1.5)
    separate src and build directories
       rename the bin dir to build

Add libraries:
  project -> properties -> java build path -> Libaries ->  add library
    user library ->  new -> name, system library, add jars 

run axis2 WSDL2Java
file -> new ->other -> Axis2Wizards Axis2 Code Generator
   select wsdl file, ->  next
   chose server-side, client-side, skeleton, default services.xml
    generate sync style only
    changed custom package name from net.es.oscars.oscars to .../OSCARS
   -> next  select the project for the generate code - OSCARS2
  -> finish  generating code
NB: this does not regenerate the OSCARSSkeleton.java,
	OSCARSMessageReceiverInOut, OSCARSStub,OSCARSSkeletonInterface.java 
    or the resources/OSCARS.wsdl, services.xml
  if any of these files already exist. 

Copied some of the axis2 jar files in lib-axis2
  project -> properties -> java build path -> add library
   defined axis2, then added jars to it.

Tried data binding none and xmlbeans
   Only creates four files: Skeleton, service stub MessageReceiverInOut
   Uses org.apache.axion.om.OMElement classes for the params.
   xmlbeans gives three times as many classes foo, fooImpl, fooDocument, 
   fooDocumentImpl
 
Using the ADB data binding I now accept a CreateReservation instead of
a ResCreateContent, and return a CreateReservationResponse instead of
a CreateReply.  Question = Does the message on the wire look different?

Create a jar file of all the classes needed for the service + the directory
META-INF with services.xml and a copy of OSCARS.wsdl
 In the package explorer page  File->Export -> Java -> jar file
 selected class and resource files. Note services.xml is created by the
axis code generator wsdl2java in the
resources directory but it wants to be in the META-INF directory in the jar
file. It also creates a OSCARSService.wsdl file there.
Copy and rename the jar file to webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/services/OSCARS.aar

while deploying changed the axis2 admin user to mrt, axis2admin. The page 
lets you upload files among other things.

Trying to get CancelReservationClient to run

Command line:
  run OSCARS2/setClassPath. set path to everything in lib,lib2, src and build
Fails with
   OSCARSService cannot be resolved to a tyoe
   same for OSCARSServiceStub and OSCARS


Eclipse
   click on the CancelReservationClient.class file and chose run
  class not found org.apache.axis2.client.stub  Is isn axis2-kernel.jar
  which is on the project build path. Don't know what eclipse is using for 
  a run path.


Ant
  Set classpath in my build.xml
     First could not find org.apache.ws.policy.Assertion
       Downloaded policy-1.0.jar from apache/commons/ws-policy
    Second could not find HttpException
       copied commons-httpclient-3.0.jar from package/axis2/lib to
       OSCARS2/lib2
   Third can't find  org/apache/ws/commons/om/OMContainer
      Version skew between Axis 1.4 and 2.0
   finally copied over all the jar files from axis2. 
   Then it worked "got could not connect to server"

Need to fix OSCARS.wsdl to point to http://localhost:9090 and try again
Now gets to the server who returns "Service not found operation terminated"
