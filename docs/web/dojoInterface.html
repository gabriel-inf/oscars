<h1>Dojo Development Notes</h1>
<p>There are several tools that will make developing new forms and servlets
easier.</p>
<h2>Firebug</h2>
<p>The use of Firebug and Firebug Lite is covered in a
<a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/book/book-dojo/part-4-meta-dojo-making-your-dojo-code-run-faster-and-better/debugging-facilities/deb">tutorial</a>
by the Dojo developers.</p>
<p>Usage of the Firebug debugger statement is somewhat temperamental.  You
can insert it at any point in the Javascript code, for example web/oscars/Form.js.
You won't see the code where it stops when you click on the Script tab
(you'll see the code for dojo.js), and if you're not careful where you move
the mouse, you're back to the HTML code inspector.  However, if you stay in the
Script tab, on the right
side of the window you can inspect any variables that exists where the
breakpoint is set, and continue to the next breakpoint and inspect
variables there.</p>
<h2>JSLint and Rhino</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Javascript syntax errors will result in cryptic messages in
Firebug such as "oscars.Form has no properties" if there is a syntax
error in web/oscars/Form.js, with no clue as to where the syntax error is.
That is where
<a href="http://www.jslint.com/rhino/index.html">JSLint and Rhino</a>
come in.  JSLint is a Javascript syntax checker that can check HTML
and Javascript files for errors and bad usage.
web/lib/jslint.js is included with the OSCARS
distribution because there is no license.</p>

<p>There are still a lot of warning messages
for files like web/oscars/Form.js, but none are fatal.  You will need
to temporarily remove embedded dojo/method scripts in the HTML files
in forms, because JSLint thinks that they are illegal locations for
Javascript.  That's still
worthwhile doing, because I found other errors once I worked around
that restriction.  JSLint will flag any Dojo regular expressions used,
but they are non-fatal.</p>

<p>
JSLint by itself
requires pasting your code into its Web page, which is very cumbersome.
With the use of Rhino, which is written in Java, you can use JSLint
on the command-line.  Unfortunately, we cannot redistribute its jar because
of licensing issues.  You can
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html">download</a> and
unzip it, and place js.jar in lib in the main directory.  After that you can
run the
syntaxChecker.sh script in web to check for syntax errors in any of the
HTML or Javascript files, for example "./syntaxChecker.sh oscars/Form.js".</p>
