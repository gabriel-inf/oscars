<h2>Database Use</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We are currently using Hibernate 3.2 to persist data objects.
Hibernate hides a multitude of details
at the JDBC level, including conversion of data types in queries and
result sets, and transaction handling.
In addition, from the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>
Web page:</p>
<quote>
"Hibernate is a powerful, high performance object/relational
persistence and query service. Hibernate lets you
develop persistent classes following object-oriented idiom - including
association, inheritance, polymorphism,
composition, and collections."
</quote>
<p>The underlying database server is <a href="http://dev.mysql.com">MySQL</a>.
Currently we are using version 5.0.
The MySQL server is set up to only accept connections from the
machine it is running on, for security reasons. It depends on the
presence of a Web server on the
same machine to forward requests to it. All requests are authenticated
and authorized via the AAA
before being passed on to Hibernate and the database.</p>
<h3>Database schema set up and population</h3>
<p>OSCARS makes use of two databases,
one for the AAA named "<span style="font-style: italic;">aaa</span>",
and one for the BSS, pathfinder, PSS and
TSS, named "<span style="font-style: italic;">bss</span>". The
Hibernate configuration information for these databases is in <code>conf/server</code>,
in the
files <code>aaa.cfg.xml</code> and <code>bss.cfg.xml</code>,
respectively. These are copied to the appropriate place in the
classpath as part of the build process.
</p>
<p>The scripts to create the necessary tables in the aaa and bss
databases are contained in
<code>sql/aaa/createTables.sql</code> and <code>sql/bss/createTables.sql</code>,
respectively. <code>sql/aaa/populateTables.sql</code> is a sample
script
setting up default attributes, resources, and permissions.</p>
<p>The program to populate the bss database with the network topology
for ESNet is located in
<code>tools/updatedb/TopologyUpdater.java</code>. It depends on the
presence of a directory with previously gathered
information about each router in the topology, which was gained using
SNMP queries. Currently the
format of the files in that directory is ESnet-specific.<br>
</p>
<p>There is a similar program in <code>tools/updatedbterce/TERCETopologyUpdate.java</code>
that will populate the bss database from the TERCE web service.<br>
</p>
<h3>Test databases</h3>
<p>Separate test databases, <span style="font-style: italic;">testaaa</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">testbss</span>, are set up for
unit tests. Make sure that they are created as well as the aaa and bss
databases. The createTables scripts in <code>sql/aaa</code> and <code>sql/bss</code>
can be used for this if the <code>use aaa;</code> and <code>use bss;</code>
statements are changed to <code>use testaaa;</code> and <code>use
testbss;</code>. They are repopulated as necessary
each time a test suite executes. Their Hibernate configuration
files are in the
<code>conf/server</code> directory, <code>testaaa.cfg.xml </code>and <code>testbss.cfg.xml</code>.
These are identical to the
production configuration files except for the names of the databases.</p>
<h3>Object/relational mapping</h3>
<p>Each table in the database has a corresponding Java bean. The
mapping is defined in the Hibernate
configuration files mentioned above. There is also a Hibernate
configuration file that maps each field
in the table to a bean property, with a suffix of ".hbm.xml", located
in the same directory as the bean.</p>
<p>OSCARS makes extensive use of the
<a href="http://www.hibernate.org/328.html">DAO</a> (data-access
object) design pattern.
Each bean, for example <code>Router.java</code>, has an associated DAO
object, in this case <code>RouterDAO.java,</code>
that performs low-level CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete)
operations. Each DAO object sub-classes
<code>src/net/es/oscars/database/GenericHibernateDAO.java</code>.
</p>
<h3>Useful MySQL commands</h3>
<p><code>mysql -u &lt;username&gt; -p</code>&nbsp;&nbsp; prompts for a
password and starts mysql</p>
<p>At the MySQL prompt:</p>
<p><code>show status;</code>&nbsp;
shows the status of a number of variables.<br>
<code>show databases;</code> &nbsp;shows what databases are available<br>
<code>connect &lt;database&gt;;</code> &nbsp;connects you to the
specified database<br>
<code>show tables;</code> &nbsp;shows all the tables in the database<br>
<code>describe &lt;table&gt;;</code> &nbsp;shows the fields of the
specified table<br>
<code>select * from &lt;table&gt;;</code> &nbsp;shows all the rows of
the specified table.<br>
</p>

documentation</a>.<br>
