<h1>OSCARS Default Attributes
</h1>
<br>
In order to facilitate the granting of authorizations to users, we have
defined a number of attributes that represent standard roles which can
be assigned to a user. In general these roles are intended to provide
all the authorizations that a user will require and hence each user
should be assigned to just one role (with a few exceptions). The role
attributes are:<br>
<br>
<h3>Role Attributes</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>OSCARS-user:</dt>
  <dd>A non-privileged user who can make and manage
his own reservations.</dd>
  <dt>OSCARS-engineer:</dt>
  <dd>A privileged user who can make reservations,
specifying&nbsp; path elements, manage all reservations, view and
modify topology and perform un-safe modifications to reservations.</dd>
  <dt>OSCARS-site-administrator:</dt>
  <dd>A privileged user who can manage all the reservations that start
or end at his site. Intended for the use of end site network
administrator to be able to completely control traffic entering or
leaving his site.</dd>
  <dt>OSCARS-operator:</dt>
  <dd>A less privileged user who can see, but not modify all user
reservations. Intended for a NOC operator to be able to see what
reservations are affected by a link outage at his site and be able to
alert the owner of the reservation or an OSCARS-engineer at his site.</dd>
  <dt>OSCARS-service:</dt>
  <dd>The role an IDC operates under. Should not be assigned to human
users.</dd>
  <dt>OSCARS-publisher:</dt>
  <dd>Is only allowed to publish events to the OSCARS Notification
server. It is intended to be used&nbsp; by an non-OSCARS service, such
as perfSONAR that should be able to publish events of interest to
OSCARS users.</dd>
  <dt>OSCARS-administrator:</dt>
  <dd>An administrative role that manages users and authorization
policy.
Can create and delete users and institutions, assigns attributes to
users, can modify the authorizations associated with attributes. Does
not
have any permission with respect to reservations.</dd>
</dl>
In general, only the OSCARS-administrator role should be
granted to someone who holds another role. If you only have one person
to manage a site, the combination of OSCARS-engineer and
OSCARS-administrator grants all privileges to the system.<br>
<br>
All users are able to see and modify their own user profile and
subscribe to notifications about reservations that they have
authorization to query.<br>
<br>
<h3>Other type of attributes</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>OSCARS-may-specify-path:</dt>
  <dd>Can be granted to a normal OSCARS-user to allow them to specify
path elements when making a reservation.</dd>
</dl>
In the future we may have project attributes that associate a user with
a research project that has special network requirements.<br>
<br>
<h3>Authorizations</h3>
Go <a href="authorizationPolicy.html#authTable">here</a> to see what
default
authorizations are granted to each attribute, or use the authorizations
tab to see what the current authorizations are.<br>
