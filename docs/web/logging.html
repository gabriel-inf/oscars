<h2>Configuring Logging</h2>
Tomcat uses commons-logging out-of-the box, but will use log4j if the
commons-logging.jar and log4j.jar files are copied to common/lib, and
there is a log4j.properties file in common/classes. Axis2 defaults to
use log4j. The OSCARS.aar inherits its logging configuration from
axis2.&nbsp; The list below shows where each component finds its
log4j.properties file.<br>
<br>
<h3>Tomcat logging</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Uses the file
${CATALINA_HOME}/common/classes/log4j.properties. The
commons-logging.jar and log4j.jar
must be added to common/lib to enable log4j logging. Otherwise, Tomcat
uses commons-logging. Tomat also uses conf/logging.properties to select
log levels for various components. The levels are set originally to
INFO, but may be changed to WARNING or SERVERE to reduce or eliminate
the manager*.log, localhost*.log, host-manager*.log, admin*.log and
catalina*.log. Since all messages at the INFO level are logged to
catalina.out, these other logs are redundant.<br>
<br>
The version of this file that is used at ESnet is included in the
distribution in conf/server/log4j.axis2.properties. The setupServer
target copies it to ${catalina.home}/common/classes. The deployaar ant
target copies the same<br>
file to ${catalina.home}/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties.</div>
<br>
<h3>Axis2 Logging<br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Uses
${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/classes/commons-logging.properties
to select no logging, simple logging or log4j. Uses the file
${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h3>OSCARS aar logging</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Uses the file
${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties, not
the one that is included in OSCARS.aar/classes/log4j.properties.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h3>OSCARS war logging</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Uses the file that is included in
OSCARS.war at classes/log4.properties. Deployed at
${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/OSCARS/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties. This
file is included in the distribution in conf/server/log4j.properties.
It is sometimes necessary to add log4j.jar to the OSCARS/WEB-INF/lib
directory to get the logging to the oscars.log file to happen.<br>
</div>
<h3>Scheduler logging</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The scheduler is started by the
tools/scheduler.sh script which sets the location of the logging
configuration file to
${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/OSCARS/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties.&nbsp;
<br>
</div>
<br>
The following log files, all in ${CATALINA_HOME}/logs are of interest:<br>
<dl>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">catalina.out</span> </dt>
  <dd>the root console log. All messages (except the httpwire and
reservation ones) are put here as well as in some of the following logs.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">hibernate.log</span> </dt>
  <dd>has output from the hibernate database modules</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">wire.log</span> </dt>
  <dd>logs what is sent as https messages from the forwarder module</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">oscars-aar.log</span> </dt>
  <dd>log messages from modules running from OSCARS. aar, e.g. process
that
started from the web services api</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">oscars.log</span> </dt>
  <dd>log messages from modules running from OSCARS.war, e.g. process
that started from the WBUI</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">scheduler.log</dt>
  <dd>log messages from the scheduler process</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">reservations</dt>
  <dd>a directory holding the log messages&nbsp; from
bss.ReservationManager for each reservation that has been made.&nbsp;
The name of this directory is set in oscars.properties as <span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">logging.rsvlogdir</span>.
It is read by bss.ReservationLogger which dynmically sets a log
appender to put the messages in a per/reservation file named by the GRI
of the reservation.<br>

<h3>Formatting conventions</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Most lines are formatted as follows:<br>
<br>
%d{ISO8601} [%5p] %c{2} %m%n<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %d{ISO8601} is date/time in the
following format&nbsp; 2008-03-04 00:06:38,260<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %5p is the log level, e.g. DEBUG,INFO in
a 5 character wide field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %c{2} is the last two components of the
class that is logging the message<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %m is the message that was logged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %n is a newline.<br>
