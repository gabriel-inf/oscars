      <h2>Overview </h2>
      <div class="content">With the advent of service sensitive
applications (such as remote-
controlled experiments, time constrained massive data transfers,
video-conferencing, etc.), it has become apparent that there is a need
to augment the services present in today's <a href="http://www.es.net/">Energy
Sciences Network</a>
(ESnet)
infrastructure. The On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance
Reservation System (OSCARS) project prototypes one such new service:
dynamically provisioned, guaranteed bandwidth secure circuits both
within ESnet, and between ESnet and other network domains. <br>
      <br>
OSCARS is funded out of the DOE Office of Science. The official <a
 href="http://www.es.net/OSCARS/">project</a> page has links to
the
original proposal, a project summary, and presentations on OSCARS.
Based on the original proposal, <a href="specs/fspec.html">functional</a>
and <a href="specs/dspec.html">design</a> specifications were written
to formalize the plans for the implementation. The original
implementation
was based on the <a
 href="https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/CPD/OSCARS+and+BRUW">Internet2
BRUW project</a>.
Since then, the two projects have merged and share a common code base. <br>
      <br>
A <a href="papers/gridnets.pdf">GridNets 2006 paper</a> goes into
the details of OSCARS as of August 2006.<br>
      <br>
Four of the links at the left of this page point to&nbsp; major
collections of of information:<br>
The two links under <a href="UserManual.html">User Manual</a> describe
how to use OSCARS two
interfaces. The <a href="DCN-SUITE-OSCARS-INSTALL.pdf">DCN/Installation
manual</a> link points to a pdf document describing how to install
OSCARS on a host that is running the Dragon software. The <a
 href="install.html">Installation</a> link points to a html manual on
how to install and configure just the OSCARS IDC code.<br>
