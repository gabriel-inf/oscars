<h1>Bandwidth Scheduling Subcomponent</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
The bandwidth scheduling component is the top level component that
schedules a reservation. It parses the createReservation request,
checks with the&nbsp;<a href="aaa.html">authorization component</a>
that the user has permission to make the reservation and then hands the
requested path to the <a href="pathfinder.html">pathfinder component</a>
to determine the actual path through the network that will be used. It
then checks to see if the required resources are available during the
requested time interval. If so, it holds those resources and creates a
Global Reservation Identifier (GRI) which will be used to identify the
reservation in each of the domains that it may traverse. If the end
point of the path is not in the local domain, the BSS forwards the
createReservation request to the next domain.&nbsp; If the reservation
is able to sucessfully hold all the resources it needs across all the
downstream domains, the local resources are scheduled and the
reservation is entered into the BSS's reservation table.<br>
<br>
<h2>Details</h2>
<br>
The createReservation message contains the path that is to be reserved,
the amount of bandwidth to be reserved, the start time for the
reservation, the duration, the burst limit, the purpose of the
reservation and if coming from another domain, the global reservation
identifier. See the <a href="wsdl.files">OSCARS wsdl files</a> for the
precise type of each of these parameters. The input path definition is
very flexible. It can mostly simply be the source and destination host
IP addresses, or can include ingress and egress points for each domain,
or even the hops within domains. It is referred to as a unconfirmed
loose hop path (ULP). At the end of the reservation process a confirmed
loose hop (CLP) is returned to the user where it has been verified that
an acutal path with the requested bandwidth can be made through these
hops.&nbsp; The way the hops are expressed depends on the layer (2 or
3) that is being specified and how the domains specify their
topologies. see <a href="tss.html">topology exchange</a>.&nbsp; <br>
