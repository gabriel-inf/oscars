<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId130537"></a>Introduction</h2>
The OSCARS Ineterdomain Controller (IDC) allows end users to reserve
high priority bandwidth between two hosts. The hosts may both be part
of the same ISP domain, or may be on different domains if each of ISPs
between the two hosts are running co-operating IDCs.
<p>There are two interfaces provided by the IDC: a forms based web
server
interface (WBUI) and a web services SOAP message interface (API). Both
are secured interfaces and require the user to be registered and
authorized by the ISP at which the reservation starts. Individual
authorization at subsequent ISPs is not required. Both interfaces
allow the user to make, query, list, modify and delete reservations. In
addition, the WBUI allows an administrator to add, authorize, and
manage users, and the user to modify his user profile.<br>
</p>
<p>The ESnet WBUI is accessible at <a
 href="https://oscars.es.net/OSCARS/">https://oscars.es.net/OSCARS/</a>.
The I2 WBUI is accessible at <a
 href="https://ndb3-blmt.abilene.ucaid.edu:8443/OSCARS">https://ndb3-blmt.abilene.ucaid.edu:8443/OSCARS</a>.
If you are connecting to I2 through an NREN, you will need to contact
them for the WBUI URL to use.<br>
</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId916500"></a>Web server interface</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId592309"></a><big>1. Login</big></h3>
Before you can access the server you must login using the user name
that you were given by the domain administrator and your password.
OCSARS will then issue a cookie to your browser that will keep you
authenticated for <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">8</span> hours.
Once you are logged in, you will see a row of tabs from which
you can select the desired action. <br>
<br>
The parts of the WBUI that you will see depends on what authorizations
you have. A normal OSCARS-user will only be able to create a
reservation, list and see the details of his own reservations and
modify his own profile. More privileged users, e.g. OSCARS-engineers
and operators can see all the reservations. Users with admin
privileges, OSCARS-Administrator can add and authorize new users and
modify and delete users. See <a
 href="file:///Users/mrt/Documents/eclipseWS/Trunk/docs/web/authorizationPolicy.html">Authorization
Policy</a> for more
information about the different levels of privileges.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId930716"></a><big>2. Create
Reservation</big></h3>
Allows the creation of new reservation. Reservations can be made
at network layer 3 only between hosts that are within ESnet.
Layer 2 specifications must be used for all interdomain
reservations. <br>
Note that ISPs use both <span style="font-style: italic;">abstract
topology</span> node names and <span style="font-style: italic;">acutal
topology</span> node names. Only abstract topology names will be seen
outside the ISP, so a user will always be dealing with the abstract
names. The actual hosts that will be used may vary and there may be
multiple hosts between two abstract hops.<br>
<br>
Hops are specified using the <span style="font-style: italic;">topology
identifier</span> defined by the Open Grid
Forum (OGF) Network Measurement Working Group (NMWG) control plane
topology schema. A topology identifier is a URN that may consist of as
many as four hierarchical componets: domain:node:port:link. See <a
 href="file:///Users/mrt/Documents/eclipseWS/Trunk/docs/web/tss.html">Topology
components notes</a> for more about the topology naming scheme.<br>
<br>
<h3>Common parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source </span>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Destination hosts</span> may be specified
by a DNS host name, IP address or topology link identifier.</li>
  <li>The following examples uses link identifiers:<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small style="font-weight: bold;">source:</small><code>
urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/3:link=*
    </code><br>
    <small style="font-weight: bold;"> destination:</small> <code>urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.193-104:link=1</code></div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path </span>is specified by a
list of topology identifiers for ingress and egress routers. In general
a path should not be specified except by someone who knows how to
traffic engineer the
traffic, and wishes to specify an non-default interdomin peering point,
e.g. if peering between ESnet/I2 in Sunnyvale is congested, we
might set ESnet/I2's address in New York to bypass the congestion.
Setting the routers may change the default path for the data flow. <br>
  </li>
  <li>However, currently for layer 2 reservations starting at ESnet
sites the ingress and egress
routers for each domain that is traversed
must be input. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">(This may change
by the time of the April release)</span> <br>
  </li>
  <li>The
hops that you specify are a
considered a <span style="font-style: italic;">Loose Interdomain Path
(LIDP)</span> are
are taken as suggestions. If they are not available, other nodes may be
substituted. By the time the path has been passed through all
the domains, an ingress and egress router for each node will have been
added and the path becomes a <span style="font-style: italic;">Strict
Interdomain Path (SIDP). </span>The path that is stored with the
reservation and displayed by the reservation details page is a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">confirmed</span> (all the
resources have been reserved) SIDP. For example the
hops for the previous source and destinations are:<br>
    <pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">    path:</span><br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/3:link=*<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/1:link=TenGigabitEthernet1/1.101<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=aofa-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet2/3:link=TenGigabitEthernet2/3.101<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=aofa-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet4/3:link=*<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.189-103:link=1<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.193-104:link=1<br></pre>
Note that the first and last hops are the same as the source and
destination hosts.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bandwidth</span> - maximum
bandwidth to reserve in Mbps</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose</span> - stored with
your reservation as part of our records.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Production circuit</span> -
check this box only if the reservation is to
be used for moving production level data.The circuits used by these
reservations will be monitored by the Network Operators and if they go
down efforts will be made to fix the problems as quickly as possible,
or to reroute the traffic.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start date, Start time </span>-
the values default to the current time.
Type in new values in the format shown.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">End date, End time</span> - the
values default to 4 minutes from the
current time. Type in new values in the format shown.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Layer 3 parameters</span><br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source port</span> - the port on
the source host from which the data
will orginate.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Destination port</span> - the
port on the destination host to which the
data will be delivered</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Protocol </span>- If you
specify the protocol your data will be using,
e.g. UDP/TCP, ESnet can police the curcuit and allow only traffic using
that protocol to use the reserved bandwidth.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DSCP</span> (Differentiated
service code point) is essentially QoS
bits. Currently BNL's Terapaths sets the DSCP code point so that it can
indicate to ESnet which flow (out of a bunch) that have the same
src/dst will use the L3 circuit.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Layer 2 parameters</span> <br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VLAN tag</span> - A VLAN
tag
allows a user to tie a certain VLAN (or sub-interface) on a port to the
transit circuit. Untagged circuits, essentially tie the entire port (or
interface) to the transit circuit. Tagging allows multiplexing multiple
VLANs over the same physical port and therefore servicing more then one
partial reservation (e.g. VLAN3000 = 5Gb/s, VLAN3001 = 2.5Gb/s,
VLAN3002 = 2.5Gb/s on a 10Gb/s link). Vtags should be choosen in the
3K-4K range or may be set to "any" , in which case the originating IDC
will assign an unused tag in an appropriate range. At this time the
same VLAN tag must be used at all the transited links, but this will
eventually change.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId364336"></a><big>3. List
Reservation</big></h3>
Depending on your privileges, list reservations will display only your
reservations or all the reservations in the system. We make
available all the reservations that have ever been made, so the
interface allows you to specify the statuses, the time periods, the
links involved and the description of the reservations to display. In
additon once a list of reservations has been displayed, you can click a
column header to have the reservations sorted by that column. The
column values are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GRI</span> (Global Reservation
Identifier) - a unique identifier assigned by the inital IDC. It is
used across domains to identify a reservation, and by the user when
querying or modifying a reservation.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">User</span> - login name of the
user who created the reservation</li>
  <li>Status - one of <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>PENDING <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">[SCHEDULED]</span>
- reservation has been made, but the scheduled start
time
has not arrived yet</li>
    <li>ACTIVE - circuit is currently provisioned</li>
    <li>FINISHED - end time has past, and circuit has been torn down</li>
    <li>CANCELLED - reservation was cancelled, circuit is not
active</li>
    <li>FAILED - Path may have failed to be setup because the required
resources were not available, or a link that the circuit uses is down
and the circuit may
still be provisioned<br>
    </li>
    <li>INVALIDATED - </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Time </span>- Date and
time at which the reservation circuit will be provisioned (times are
displayed in the local time zone of the browser)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">End Time</span> - Date and time
at which the reservation circuit will be torn down</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Origin</span> - Node at which
the data flow starts</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Destination </span>- Node at
which the data flow ends</li>
</ul>
If you click on a GRI, you will see the details of the
reservation.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId323456"></a><big>4.
