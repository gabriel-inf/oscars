<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId130537"></a>Introduction</h2>
The OSCARS Ineterdomain Controller (IDC) allows end users to reserve
high priority bandwidth between two hosts. The hosts may both be part
of the same ISP domain, or may be on different domains if each of ISPs
between the two hosts are running co-operating IDCs.
<p>There are two interfaces provided by the IDC: a forms based web
server
interface (WBUI) and a web services SOAP message interface (API). Both
are secured interfaces and require the user to be registered and
authorized by the ISP at which the reservation starts. Individual
authorization at subsequent ISPs is not required. Both interfaces
allow the user to make, query, list, modify and delete reservations. In
addition, the WBUI allows an administrator to add, authorize, and
manage users, and the user to modify his user profile.
</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId916500"></a>Web server interface</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId592309"></a>login</h3>
Before you can access the server you must login using the user name
that you were given by the domain administrator and your password.
OCSARS will then issue a cookie to your browser that will keep you
authenticated for <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NN</span>&nbsp;
hours. Once you are logged in, you will see a row of tabs from which
you can select the desired action.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The parts of the WBUI that you will see depends on what authorizations
you have. A normal OSCARS-user will only be able to create a
reservation, list and see the details of his own reservations and
modify his own profile. More privileged users, e.g. OSCARS-engineers
and operators can see all the reservations. Users with admin
privileges, OSCARS-Administrator can add and authorize new users and
modify and delete users. See <a
 href="file:///Users/mrt/Documents/eclipseWS/Trunk/docs/web/authorizationPolicy.html">Authorization
Policy</a> for more
information about the different levels of privileges.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId930716"></a>create reservation</h3>
Allows the creation of&nbsp; new reservation. Reservations can be made
at&nbsp; network layer 3 only between hosts that are within ESnet.
Layer 2 specifications must be used for all interdomain
reservations.&nbsp; <br>
Note that ISPs use both <span style="font-style: italic;">abstract
topology</span> node names and <span style="font-style: italic;">acutal
topology</span> node names. Only abstract topology names will be seen
outside the ISP, so a user will always be dealing with the abstract
names. The actual hosts that will be used may vary and there may be
multiple hosts between two abstract hops.<br>
<br>
Hops are specified using the <span style="font-style: italic;">topology
identifier</span> defined by the Open Grid
Forum (OGF) Network Measurement Working Group (NMWG) control plane
topology schema. A topology identifier is a URN that may consist of as
many as four hierarchical componets: domain:node:port:link. See <a
 href="file:///Users/mrt/Documents/eclipseWS/Trunk/docs/web/tss.html">Topology
components notes</a> for more about the topology naming scheme.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Layer 3 parameters</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Source and host destinations may be specified by a DNS host name
or an IP address. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The path need not be specified since it is entirely within ESnet
and the IDC will caculate a shortest path between the two hosts.
If&nbsp; hosts have multiple connections to ESnet you may specify a
ingress or egress router.</li>
  <li>Source port - the port on the source host from which the data
will orginate.</li>
  <li>Destination port - the port on the destination host to which the
data will be delivered</li>
  <li>Protocol - If you specify the protocol your data will be using,
e.g. udp/tcp, ESnet can police the curcuit for that traffic and limit
it to your reserved bandwidth.</li>
  <li>DSCP (Differentiated service code point)&nbsp; is essentially QoS
bits. Currently BNL's Terapaths sets the DSCP code point so that it can
indicate to ESnet which flow (out of a bunch) that have the same
src/dst will use the L3 circuit.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Layer 2 parameters</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Source and host destinations are specified as topology
identifiers. They are the router port/link at which the data will enter
and leave the ISPs. For example:<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small style="font-weight: bold;">source:</small><code>
urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/3:link=*
    </code><br>
    <small style="font-weight: bold;"> destination:</small> <code>urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.193-104:link=1</code></div>
    <br>
There is a lookup service under development for hosts that will return
the domain/node/port/link urn to which they connect. </li>
  <li>Path is specified by a list of topology identifiers. For now at
least the ingress and egress routers for each domain that is traversed
must be input. The hops that you specify are a considered a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Loose Interdomain Path (LIDP)</span> are
are taken as suggestions. If they are not available, other nodes&nbsp;
may be substituted. By the time the path has been passed through all
the domains, an ingress and egress router for each node will have been
added and the path becomes a <span style="font-style: italic;">Strict
Interdomain Path (SIDP). </span>The path that is stored with the
reservation and displayed by the reservation details page is a
confirmed (all the resources have been reserved) SIDP. For example the
hops for the previous source and destinations are:<br>
    <pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">    path:</span><br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/3:link=*<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/1:link=TenGigabitEthernet1/1.101<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=aofa-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet2/3:link=TenGigabitEthernet2/3.101<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=aofa-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet4/3:link=*<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.189-103:link=1<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.193-104:link=1<br></pre>
Note that the first and last hops are the same as the source and
destination hosts.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>VLAN is a tag chosen by the user, but if that tag is already in
use it may be rejected and cause the reservation to fail. A VLAN tag
allows a user to tie a certain vlan (or sub-interface) on a port to the
transit circuit. Untagged circuits, essentially tie the entire port (or
interface) to the transit circuit. Tagging allows multiplexing multiple
VLANs over the same physical port and therefore servicing more then one
partial reservation (e.g. VLAN3000 = 5Gb/s, VLAN3001 = 2.5Gb/s,
VLAN3002 = 2.5Gb/s on a 10Gb/s link). Vtags should be choosen in the
3K-4K range.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Common parameters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bandwidth - maximum bandwidth to reserve in Mbps</li>
  <li>Purpose - stored with your reservation as part of our records.</li>
  <li>Production circuit - check this box only if the reservation is to
be used for moving production level data.The circuits used by these
reservations will be monitored by the Network Operators and if they go
down efforts will be made to fix the problems as quickly as possible,
or to reroute the traffic.</li>
  <li>Start date, Start time - the values default to the current time.
Type in new values in the format shown.</li>
  <li>End date, End time - the values default to 4 minutes from the
current time. Type in new values in the format shown.</li>
