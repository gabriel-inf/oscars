 name="Login"></a>Login</big></h3>
Before you can access the server you must login using the user name
that you were given by the domain administrator and your password.
OCSARS will then issue a cookie to your browser that will keep you
authenticated for <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">8</span> hours.
Once you are logged in, you will see a row of tabs from which
you can select the desired action. <br>
<br>
The parts of the WBUI that you will see depends on what authorizations
you have. A normal OSCARS-user will only be able to create a
reservation, list and see the details of his own reservations and
modify his own profile. More privileged users, e.g. OSCARS-engineers
and OSCARS-operators can see all the reservations. Users with admin
privileges, OSCARS-administrator can add and authorize new users and
modify and delete users. See <a href="authorizationPolicy.html">Authorization
Policy</a> for more
information about the different levels of privileges.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId752007"></a><big>2. <a
 name="CreateReservation"></a>Create
Reservation</big></h3>
Allows the creation of new reservation. Reservations can be made
at network layer 3 only between hosts that are within ESnet.
Layer 2 specifications must be used for all interdomain
reservations. <br>
Note that ISPs use both <span style="font-style: italic;">abstract
topology</span> node names and <span style="font-style: italic;">actual
topology</span> node names. Only abstract topology names will be seen
outside the ISP, so a user will always be dealing with the abstract
names. The actual hosts that will be used may vary and there may be
multiple hosts between two abstract hops.<br>
<br>
Hops are specified using the <span style="font-style: italic;">topology
identifier</span> defined by the Open Grid
Forum (OGF) Network Measurement Working Group (NMWG) control plane
topology schema. A topology identifier is a URN that may consist of as
many as four hierarchical components: domain:node:port:link. See <a
 href="tss.html">Topology
components notes</a> for more about the topology naming scheme.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId79347"></a><a
 name="CommonParameters"></a>Common parameters</h4>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source </span>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Destination hosts</span> may be specified
by a DNS host name, IP address or as a
topology link identifier. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Example for layer 3 reservation:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><small style="font-weight: bold;">source:</small><code>
198.124.220.135</code> </li>
    <li><small style="font-weight: bold;">destination:</small><code>
tera03.ultralight.org</code> </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Example for layer 2 reservation using link identifiers:<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small style="font-weight: bold;">source:</small><code>
urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/3:link=*
    </code><br>
    <small style="font-weight: bold;"> destination:</small> <code>urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.193-104:link=1</code></div>
  </li>
  <li>For layer3 reservations the hosts are the machines on which the
data resides. If a host name is specified, the DNS will be used to
resolve it to an IPaddr.
If a topology identifier is specified, the associated IPaddr will be
found from the topology database. For layer2 reservations, they are the
ingress and egress links to the ISP. If they are input as a host names
or IPaddrs
the DNS and a lookup server are used to resolve them to topology
identifiers. Alternatively, a user may
communicate with the ISP administrators to find out what topology
identifiers to use. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path </span>is a
list of topology identifiers for ingress and egress links/routers. In
general
a path should not be specified except by someone who knows how to
traffic engineer the
traffic, and wishes to specify an non-default interdomain peering
point,
e.g. if peering between ESnet/I2 in Sunnyvale is congested, one
might set ESnet/I2's address in New York to bypass the congestion.
Setting the routers may change the default path for the data flow.
However, currently for layer 2 reservations starting at ESnet
sites the ingress and egress links for each domain that is traversed
must be input. This may change in
the future.</li>
  <li>The hops that you specify are a
considered a <span style="font-style: italic;">Loose Interdomain Path
(LIDP)</span> are
are taken as suggestions. If they are not available, other nodes may be
substituted. By the time the path has been passed through all
the domains, an ingress and egress link for each domain will have been
added and the path becomes a <span style="font-style: italic;">Strict
Interdomain Path (SIDP). </span>The path that is stored with the
reservation and displayed by the reservation details page is a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">confirmed</span> (all the
resources have been reserved) SIDP. For example the
hops for the layer 2 example above are:<br>
    <pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">    path:</span><br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/3:link=*<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=bnl-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet1/1:link=TenGigabitEthernet1/1.101<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=aofa-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet2/3:link=TenGigabitEthernet2/3.101<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=es.net:node=aofa-mr1:port=TenGigabitEthernet4/3:link=*<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.189-103:link=1<br>    urn:ogf:network:domain=dcn.internet2.edu:node=newy-vlsr:port=10.100.80.193-104:link=1<br></pre>
Note that the first and last hops are the same as the source and
destination hosts. Currently this is required for layer 2 reservations,
but may change in the future.<br>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Production circuit</span> -
check this box only if the reservation is to
be used for moving production level data.The circuits used by these
reservations will be monitored by the Network Operators and if they go

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Source port</span> - the port on

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Protocol </span>- If you
specify the protocol your data will be using,
e.g. UDP/TCP, ESnet can police the circuit and allow only traffic using
that protocol to use the reserved bandwidth.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DSCP</span> (Differentiated
service code point) is essentially QoS
bits. Currently BNL's Terapaths sets the DSCP code point so that it can

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VLAN tag</span> - A VLAN
tag
allows a user to tie a certain VLAN (or sub-interface) on a port to the
transit circuit. Untagged circuits, essentially tie the entire port (or
interface) to the transit circuit. Tagging allows multiplexing multiple
VLANs over the same physical port and therefore servicing more then one
partial reservation (e.g. VLAN3000 = 5Gb/s, VLAN3001 = 2.5Gb/s,
VLAN3002 = 2.5Gb/s on a 10Gb/s link). Vtags should be chosen in the
3K-4K range or may be set to "<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">any</span>" , in which
case the originating IDC
will assign an unused tag in an appropriate range. At this time the
same VLAN tag must be used at all the transited links, but this will
eventually change.<br>

Depending on your privileges, list reservations will display only your
reservations, reservations starting or ending at your site, or all the
reservations in the system. We keep a record of
all the reservations that have ever been made, so the
interface allows you to specify the statuses, the time periods, the
links involved and the description of the reservations to display. In
addition once a list of reservations has been displayed, you can click
a
column header to have the reservations sorted by that column. The
column values are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GRI</span> (Global Reservation
Identifier) - a unique identifier assigned by the initial IDC. It is
used across domains to identify a reservation, and by the user when
querying or modifying a reservation.</li>
