<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId599890"></a>OSCARS Message
Security</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId581238"></a>Overview</h3>
The OSCARS Web pages and Web Services are run within a Tomcat container
which uses SSL connections
to encrypt all messages. The OSCARS Web Service interface is run as an
axis2 service within the
Tomcat container that has message signing implemented by the Rampart
software. The SSL connection assures
the user that he is connecting to a legitimate OSCARS server, and
encrypts all data that passes between the client and the server. The
message signing assures the OSCARS service that the request came from
an authenticated user that can be matched against its list of
authorized users. Signed messages are required rather than SSL client
authentication, because there may be more than one host machine between
the client
and the OSCARS service. Signed messages assure end-to-end
authentication, where SSL does only point-to-point
authentication.
<p>The client needs to have access to a private key and its matching
X509 certificate for message signing,
and the the X509 certificate chain of the server that it is contacting.
The Tomcat server needs access to a private key and X509 certificate to
identify itself to the client and to encrypt the SSL connection.
The OSCARS service needs the X509 certificate of the CA (Certificate
Authority) that issued the user certificate
in order to authenticate the message signature.
</p>
<p>There is an additional complication presented by the interdomain
architecture. The OSCARS server and OSCARS
scheduler in each domain will also act as a client when information
about a reservation needs to be forwarded
to an adjacent domain. Thus on an OSCARS server host there will be both
server and client configurations.
</p>
<p>Since all of the code is in Java, the private keys and certificates
are kept in Java keystore files, and the configuration information is
kept in properties files.
</p>
<p>Most of the configuration and keystore files contain information
that is private to a domain
or user. The source code available from our <a href="subversion.html">code
repository</a> includes
samples of these files in the conf/examples directory. They will allow
the user alice with a
certificate from the OASIS Interop Test CA to contact the server.You
will need to edit these files
to add the host and server certificates and user keys from your own
site.

The services.xml and keystore files are installed at
${catalina_home}/shared/classes/server and are domain specific. The

https://oscars.es.net/esnet/domain. The ant target "setupServer" will

Examples of

messages and keyEntry for the service to sign response
messages.
<p> Tomcat needs the keystore referenced in<code>
${catalina.home}/conf/server.xml</code> to do server-side ssl. <br>
If no keystoreFile entry is specified in the https connector element of
<code>server.xml</code>, the file <code>~/.keystore</code> is used. If
no keystorePass entry is specified the password is "changeit".<br>
On the oscars servers the keystoreFile element is specified as
/root/.keystore. The keystore contains a <span
