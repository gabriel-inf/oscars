<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId599890"></a>OSCARS Message
Security</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId581238"></a>Overview</h3>
The OSCARS Web pages and Web Services are run within a Tomcat container
which uses SSL connections
to encrypt all messages. The OSCARS Web Service interface is run as an
axis2 service within the
Tomcat container that has message signing implemented by the Rampart
software. The SSL connection assures
the user that he is connecting to a legitimate OSCARS server, and
encrypts all data that passes between the client and the server. The
message signing assures the OSCARS service that the request came from
an authenticated user that can be matched against its list of
authorized users. Signed messages are required rather than SSL client
authentication, because there may be more than one host machine between
the client
and the OSCARS service. Signed messages assure end-to-end
authentication, where SSL does only point-to-point
authentication.
<p>The client needs to have access to a private key and its matching
X509 certificate for message signing,
and the the X509 certificate chain of the server that it is contacting.
The Tomcat server needs access to a private key and X509 certificate to
identify itself to the client and to encrypt the SSL connection.
The OSCARS service needs the X509 certificate of the CA (Certificate
Authority) that issued the user certificate
in order to authenticate the message signature.
</p>
<p>There is an additional complication presented by the interdomain
architecture. The OSCARS server and OSCARS
scheduler in each domain will also act as a client when information
about a reservation needs to be forwarded
to an adjacent domain. Thus on an OSCARS server host there will be both
server and client configurations.
</p>
<p>Since all of the code is in Java, the private keys and certificates
are kept in Java keystore files, and the configuration information is
kept in properties files.
</p>
<p>Most of the configuration and keystore files contain information
that is private to a domain
or user. The source code available from our <a href="subversion.html">code
repository</a> includes
samples of these files in the conf/examples directory. They will allow
the user alice with a
certificate from the OASIS Interop Test CA to contact the server.You
will need to edit these files
to add the host and server certificates and user keys from your own
site.
</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId414171"></a>Configuration Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>axis2.xml</b> Used by OSCARS client. <br>
Names the security properties file (sec-client.properties); the user
who will sign the message; specifies that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">outflow messages</span> are to be signed
and time stamped and that <span style="font-style: italic;">inflow
messages</span> are to be time stamped. This file is found by setting
the -Daxis2.xml=&lt;pathname&gt; Java option, or programatically by a
System.setProperty("axis2.xml",&lt;pathname&gt; ). The pathname must be
on the classpath. An absolute pathname does not seem to work.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>services.xml</b> Used by OSCARS service. <br>
Names the security.properties file to use on the server side
(sec-server.properties). Specifies that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">inflow messages</span> are signed and time
stamped and <span style="font-style: italic;">outflow messages</span>
are time stamped. Copied from conf/server to the oscars.aar file in
META-INF/services.xml by the ant <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">aar</span> target.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>sec-client.properties </b> Used by OSCARS client. <br>
Contains the name and password of the keystore that the client uses
when signing a message. Its name is specified in axis2.xml. This file
must be on the classpath of the client.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>sec-server.properties </b> Used by OSCARS service. <br>
Contains the name and password of the keystore that the server will use
to verify signed messages. Its name is specified in services.xml. This
file must be on the services's classpath. It is copied from
[conf/examples|$DOMAIN_HOME]/server/ to
$CATALINA_HOME/shared/classes/server by the <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">setupServer</span> ant
task.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>repo/sec-client.properties </b> Used by the OSCARS service
when it is acting as a client when forwarding a request to an adjacent
domain. <br>
Contains the name and password of the keystore used when signing a
forwarded message. On the ESnet servers the messages are signed by the
server credential:
oscars-dev.es.net or oscars-test.es.net. The name of this file is
specified in $CATALINA_HOME/shared/classes/repo/axis2.xml). This file
must be on the classpath of the server. It is also used by the
scheduler when contacting an adjacent domain to instantiate the routing
request. The&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">setupServer</span>
ant task will copy it from [conf/examples|$DOMAIN_HOME]/server to&nbsp;
$CATALINA_HOME/shared/classes/repo.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId209738"></a> Keystore files</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>sec-client.jks</b> Used by OSCARS client and the server when
forwarding a request to another domain.<br>
Contains a <span style="font-style: italic;">keyEntry</span> for the
client that is signing the message and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span> for any trusted
CAs, e.g. any CAs in the chain that signed the user's certificate. File
is named in <code>sec-client.properties</code>. Must be on the
classpath.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>sec-server.jks</b> Used by OSCARS service. <br>
Contains the <span style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEtries</span>
for any trusted CAs, e.g. any CAs in the chain that signed the users
certificate. File is named in <code>sec-server.properties</code>. Must
be on the classpath. It is copied from
[conf/examples|$DOMAIN_HOME]/server/ to
$CATALINA_HOME/shared/classes/server by the <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">setupServer</span> ant
task.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>ssl-keystore.jks</b>- used by the OSCARS client when
establishing an ssl connection to a Tomcat server. It needs to contain <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span> for the server
and its issuer chain. e.g. oscars-dev.es.net or oscars.es.net, "ESnet
SSL Server Certificates" and "ESnet Root CA 1" Location hard-coded into
    <code>KeyManagement.java</code> as <code>System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore",repo
+"/ssl-keystore.jks")</code>; where repo is an input string to <code>setKeyStore(String
repo)</code>. It is copied from [conf/examples|$DOMAIN_HOME]/client/ to
$CATALINA_HOME/shared/classes/repo by the <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">setupServer</span> ant
task.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>/root/.keystore</b> Used by the Tomcat server. <br>
The keystore used by the Tomcat server when accepting the ssl
connection. The name is specified in <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml</code>
as the keystoreFile. It must contain a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">keyEntry</span> for the server with the
alias Tomcat e.g. oscars-dev.es.net and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries </span>for the issuers
of that certificate. This file is created as part of the process of
configuring Tomcat for SSL.
    <p> </p>

</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId293790"></a> Class Files </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>net/es/oscars/client/security/PWCallback.java</b> Called by <code>org.apache.rampart.handler.WSDoAllSender.processMessage</code>.
    <br>
Contains the password for the keys in <code>sec-client.jks</code>.
Must be on classpath.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>net/es/oscars/client/security/KeyManagement.java</b>&nbsp;
setKeyStore called by Client.setup and Forwarder.setup <br>
Sets the name and the password for the client-side <code>ssl-keystore.jks</code>
file. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId845833"></a>Client side</h3>
Needs an <code>axis2.xml</code> file to generate signed messages.
<p> Needs <code>sec-client.properties</code> to define the keystore
file and password. </p>
<p> Needs <code>sec-client.jks</code> with the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">keyEntry</span> for the user who will be
signing messages and the <span style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span>
for this issuers who signed his cert and signed the certs of the OSCARS
service that he is contacting. <a href="keytool.html">Keytool</a> can
be used to create or enter a keyEntry and to enter <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span>. </p>
<p> Needs <code>ssl-keystore.jks</code> to hold the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span> for the ssl
connection to the Tomcat server. The name and the password for this
file are hard-coded into<i> </i><code>net.es.oscars.client.security.KeyManagement.</code>
Use <a href="keytool.html">keytool</a> to add a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntr</span>y for this
certificate. </p>
<p> The default ant task in examples/javaClients/build.xml will create
and populate a repo directory with all these pieces. The user may want
to edit the <code>axis2.xml</code> to chose a different user to sign
the message and may want to add additional <span
 style="font-style: italic;">keyEntries</span> to <code>sec-client.jks</code>.<br>
See <a href="keytool.html">keytool.html</a>
for instructions on how to do this.<br>
</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId734881"></a>Server side</h3>
OSCARS needs the properties and keystore referenced in <code>OSCARS.aar:META-INF/services.xml</code>.<br>
<code> Services.xml</code> comes from <code>conf/server/services.xml</code>.
The properties and keystore files are installed at
${catalina_home}/shared/classes/server and are domain specific. The
ones for ESnet are checked into
https://oscars.es.net/esnet/domain. The ant target "setupServer" will
copy
them from <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><code>examples|$DOMAIN_HOME/conf/server
</code>into&nbsp;<code></code>${catalina_home}/shared/classes/server.
Examples of
these files can be found in <code>examples/conf/server</code>. The
server
keystore only needs <span style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span>
for all the authorized user's certificate issuers since response
messages are not signed.
<p> Tomcat needs the keystore referenced in<code>
${catalina.home}/conf/server.xml</code> to do server-side ssl. <br>
If no keystoreFile entry is specified in the https connector element of
<code>server.xml</code>, the file <code>~/.keystore</code> is used. If
no keystorePass entry is specified the password is "changeit".<br>
On the oscars servers the keystoreFile element is specified as
/root/.keystore. The keystore contains a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">keyEntry</span> for the
oscars/oscars.es.net
cert/key with alias tomcat and the <span style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEntries</span>
for the CAs in its certificate chain. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId557506"></a>Server acting as
client, e.g when forwarding request to next Domain</h3>
Needs a client keystore with <span style="font-style: italic;">trustedCertEnties</span>
and service <span style="font-style: italic;">keyEntry</span>.
The ant task "<span style="font-style: italic;">setupServer</span>"
will create the <code>${catalina.home}/shared/classes/repo</code>
directory. The files&nbsp; <code>axis2.xml,
sec-client.properties, sec-client.jks</code> and <code>ssl-keystore.jks</code>
will&nbsp; be either copied from examples/conf/client or
$DOMAIN_HOME/conf/client by the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">setupServer</span> ant
task.<br>
