<p>Top-level package for OSCARS.</p>

<p>
The classes in this package provide core functionality (logging,
property handling, etc).  There are a number of sub-packages which
instantiate the various OSCARS components.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>aaa</strong> provides functionality for authentication,
authorization, and user administration.</li>

<li><strong>bss</strong> contains classes for reservation scheduling.</li>

<li><strong>pathfinder</strong> contains various classes, implementing a
common interface, for finding a path between a source and destination.
Currently they are designed to be library calls (to start out simply), but
could be generated from a WSDL description in the future, as in AMPS.</li>

<li><strong>pss</strong> contains functionality for circuit setup.</li>

<li><strong>database</strong> provides common functionality for
data access object (DAO) operations.</li>

<li><strong>oscars</strong> classes were
originally skeletons generated using the WSDL2Java package on the OSCARS.wsdl
file, and have been filled in with OSCARS functionality.  These classes
are called on the server side when the client API is used.</li>

<li><strong>servlets</strong> contains the servlet code contacted
by the browser interface.</li>

<li><strong>client</strong> contains functionality used by clients of
OSCARS, currently the example clients and the forwarder client.</li>

<li><strong>interdomain</strong> contains classes to forward a message to
the next domain, if any. At some point they may be generated from a
WSDL description, as in AMPS.</li>

<li><strong>wsdlTypes</strong> contains wsdl2java generated 
classes that are used by both client and server code.</li>
