<p>Schedules reservation, circuit, and notification related jobs using the
    Quartz job scheduler.</p>
 <p>
Each class in this package handles an operation related to reservation
handling, circuit setup and teardown, or notifications.  Jobs for an
operation are scheduled in a specific order within a class, and in some
cases groups of classes handle the lifecycle
of a particular operation, for example circuit handling.
