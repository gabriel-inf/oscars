<p>Service files generated by the Axis2 wsdl2java program.</p>
<p>
Classes in this directory were originally generated by wsdl2java and have
been modified to incorporate OSCARS functionality.  They implement the
OSCARS service described in OSCARS.wsdl, and calls from the
client API are handled by these classes.
