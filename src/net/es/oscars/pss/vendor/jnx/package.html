<p>Handles configuring Juniper routers for circuit
   set up, teardown, and status checking.</p>

<p>Provides functionality for circuit set up, teardown, and status
checking using Juniper routers.  Router configuration templates in Junoscript
XML format contain placeholders for the parameters to be used in the specific
circuit operation.  This package fills in these parameters for a specific
instance, ssh's into a particular router, and writes the instance to the router.
An LSP is set up, torn down, or has its status checked as a result.
Results are returned as XML files.
