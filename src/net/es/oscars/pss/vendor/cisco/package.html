<p>Handles configuring Cisco routers for circuit
   set up, teardown, and status checking.</p>

<p>Provides functionality for circuit set up, teardown, and status
checking using Cisco routers.  Router configuration templates in text
format contain placeholders for the parameters to be used in the specific
circuit operation.  This package fills in these parameters for a specific
instance, clogin's into a particular router, and writes the instance to the
router.
An LSP is set up or torn down, or has its status checked as a result.
