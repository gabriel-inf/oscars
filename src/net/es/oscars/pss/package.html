<p>Provides the functionality for circuit set up, refresh, teardown, and
status checking.</p>
<p>
This package handles the portion of the reservation life cycle where a
circuit is actually instantiated or torn down, due either to a timer
mechanism or a user signal.  Sub-packages provide domain and router-specific
ways of doing so.
