<p>Provides for forwarding calls to the next domain in the chain.</p>

<p>
The classes in this package provide for forwarding a request to the next
domain down the path that conforms to the service API, if any.
</p>

<p>
Note that this assumes that a path from source to destination has already
been determined by classes in the pathfinder component.  Classes in
that component determine whether there is a next domain to forward a 
message to.
