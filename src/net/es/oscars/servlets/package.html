<p>Provides servlet classes handling browser form submissions.
</p>
 <p>
This package provides two classes of servlets, one to handle AAA requests,
and one to handle BSS requests.  For the BSS requests, the form parameters are
packaged up and sent via RMI to an RMI server instance, which then forwards
the request to the core OSCARS server.
