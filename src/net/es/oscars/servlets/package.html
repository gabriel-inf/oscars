 <p>Servlets handling input from the browser interface.</p>
 <p>
 This package contains functionality for handling input from Web
 browser forms.   For BSS-related calls, it converts form parameters to
 Axis2 types before passing them to the BSS.  BSS-related servlets can
 also act as Axis clients to other OSCARS/IDC services.
