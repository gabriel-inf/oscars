OSCARS version 0.5
===================

DATE: March 1, 2007

This branch is the main development branch.

Note that the aaa and bss databases must be set up correctly before
OSCARS will work (ant sql task to be provided).

The build.xml file uses properties from conf/private/server/oscars.properties,
which should be copied to $CATALINA_HOME using the provided Ant task.
Test properties are in conf/private/server/test.properties, which are
also copied by the Ant task.
