This directory contains an example of a server/oscars.properties used
by an OSCARS installation on a network running DRAGON. It is intended to be a
starting point for new installations. Many of the property values contained 
within the file will need to be changed for use with your specific network.
All remaining configuration files can be found in the ../examples directory.
