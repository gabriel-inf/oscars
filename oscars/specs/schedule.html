<h1>OSCARS schedule and progress a/o 11-17-2005</h1>

<p>This will be converted to some sort of timeline to reduce redundancies
and indicate dependencies.</p>

<h2>10-4 to 10-21</h2> 

<ul>
<li>Replaced use of configuration file with AAAS and BSS database tables.
Subversion updates to configuration file had been problematic, since some 
information in it was private to ESnet, but all config fields and 
corresponding values were necessary for OSCARS configuration.
This modification required changes in large sections of the code, in all
components.</li>
<br/>

<li>Met with Mary and Chin about security requirements.  Drew up initial
workflow.</li>
<br/>

<li>Copied oscars repository to oscars-dev.es.net, and private repository to 
oscars-test.es.net in preparation for migration from current oscars.es.net 
machine. </li>
<br/>

<li>Worked on post-installation steps for MySQL.
Copied databases to oscars-test from oscars.es.net.</li>
<br/>

<li>Worked on security additions to functional and design specifications.</li>
<br/>

<li>OSCARS meeting with Chin and BRUW, JRA3, SA3, JRA5.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>10-21 to 10-28</h2>

<ul>
<li>Continued security additions to functional and design specifications.</li>
<br/>

<li>Moved OSCARS repository from oscars-dev to oscars-test, and 
started testing AAAS and BSS servers on oscars-test.  (At this point
the plan was to have the WBUI and CGI scripts on oscars-dev) 
The semi- production servers still ran on oscars.es.net.</li>
<br/>

<li>Continued modifying security implementation and workflow through
discussions with Mary.  In retrospect, more would have been accomplished
in this and the previous period if I had gotten Mary more seriously 
involved earlier, as I was getting bogged down in the security details.</li>
<br/>

<li>Started working on httpd configuration files for oscars-dev and
oscars-test for new setup.  Read large amount of material on 
Apache Web server.
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>10-31 to 11-6</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decided to have the oscars-dev Web server act only as a reverse proxy to 
the oscars-test Web server, and have the WBUI and CGI scripts on oscars-test.
</li>
<br/>

<li>Discussed with Mary the usage of SSL in Apache reverse proxy setup,
and writing a module to handle XML Signatures on oscars-test.</li>
<br/>

<li>Cleaned up database query utility methods, so that all requests and
result handling are done
in the same way.  Cleaned up way database connection handle is used.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finished security additions to functional specification.</li>
<br/>

<li>Continued working on httpd configuration files for oscars-dev and
oscars-test for new setup.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>11-7 to 11-13</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned up time zone handling so that reservations from users from
other time zones finally have correct times.</li>
<br/>

<li>Got mod_soap working to enable use of Apache as a host for SOAP endpoints,
as opposed to running separate processes for AAAS and BSS.  The functionality
provided by Apache then becomes more available, for example logging.
</li>
<br/>

<li>Refactored database query, traceroute, and LSP config handling material in 
BSS, so that material necessary for traceroutes and LSP configuration all 
consolidated in the appropriate directories.  The boundaries had previously
been muddled.</li>
<br/>

<li> Debugged AAAS and BSS servers working with these changes, whether the 
client was the browser or the API.</li>
<br/>

<li>Mary worked on implementing a module for XML signature generation and 
validation.</li>
<br/>

<li>Continued working on httpd configuration files for oscars-dev and
oscars-test for new setup.</li>
<br/>

<li>Started major overhaul of CGI scripts in preparation for use of
mod_perl to handle form submissions.</li>
<br/>

<li>Started to make reservation LSP setup a set of SOAP calls.  Previously
LSP configuration had been performed by a 
separate thread started by the BSS, which had polled the database
regularly to see if reservations had become current or expired.
Converting the functionality to SOAP calls enables the use of cron
scripts to perform schedling.
It will also enable later functionality such as
explicitly claiming a reservation, rather than having all reservations
automatically be claimed on reaching their scheduled time.</li>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>11-14 to 11-20</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish move of repository by figuring out error in accessing
Subversion directories via https or http (as opposed to file://)).</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish security additions to design specification, including use of 
reverse proxy.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish working on httpd configuration files for oscars-dev and
oscars-test for new setup.  Figure out why either server can
be accessed through
https directly, but a reverse proxy from oscars-dev to
oscars-test results in the SSL connection being refused.</li>
<br/>

<li>Moved notification messages and BSS method parameter validation to
AAAS SOAP Dispatcher.  This was done to have all auditing and validation in one 
place, to make it easier to have a chain of request handlers in one
place.  This will make it easier to add additional request handlers in
the Dispatcher, such as the one to validate XML Signature, or any handlers for
BRUW-specific AAA material.</li>
<br/>

<li>Use mod_perl instead of CGI scripts, reading large amount of mod_perl
material in the process.  Using mod_perl brings in a large amount of
functionality for free.</li>
<br/>

<li>Mary continued working on implementing XML signature generation and 
validation.</li>
<br/>

<li>Rework authorization mechanisms in preparation for moving
to ROAM authorization service.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>11-21 to 11-23</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start integration of ROAM material into clients, servers, and database 
schemas.  Start working on ROAM-style resources, attributes, etc.</li>
<br/>

<li>Work with I2 on integrating BRUW material, and on inter-domain 
demo.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish debugging AAAS and BSS servers, at which point the OSCARS repository,
CGI scripts, and HTML pages are served off of oscars-test.</li>
<br/>

<li>Make the oscars.es.net IP a virtual host on oscars-dev (which is 
reverse proxied to the Web server on oscars-test).  Old machine will be
readdressed.</li>
<br/>

<li>Send notifications on modifications and deletion of reservations.</li>
<br/>

<li> Mary continues working on implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation, to be able to require signed certificates for API 
access to OSCARS, including access by another domain's server.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>11-28 to 12-2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Work on inter-domain specs documents, including workflow, with 
input from I2, GEANT2.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish integration of ROAM material.</li>
<br/>

<li>Get administrative page to add user and attributes working.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add forms for user requests for attributes/rights.</li>
<br/>

<li>Have regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs tables
based on SNMP queries (need to integrate BSS/SNMP code).</li>
<br/>

<li> Mary completes initial implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation.  Works with I2 if they need assistance in
incorporating it into their version of OSCARS/BRUW.</li>
<br/>

<li>Complete inter-domain demo to/from I2.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>12-2 to 12-9</h2>

<ul>
<li>Save the current page in use in a cookie, and enable the user to
return to an OSCARS page after going someplace else.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add modify and delete actions (in addition to cancel) on
reservation detail page.  Delete will move the reservation entry to another 
table.</li>
<br/>

<li>Return an error message if a server is not running (currently either
a blank page is returned, or else no action appears to have been taken).</li>
<br/>

<li>If a user explicitly specifies an egress or ingress router, have an
asterisk after that field in the notification sent to admin users.</li>
<br/>

<li>SOAP working with WSDL service description.</li>
<br/>

<li>Have status information flash when the status message changes.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>12-12 to Christmas break</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use MySQL 5 views to more cleanly allow access to different fields
in a table, based on user permissions.</li>
<br/>

<li>Purge logs after they get bigger than a specified amount.</li>
<br/>

<li>Require reservation log to be accessible via reservation detail page
for users with engineering privileges.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add "recompute route" button" to reservation details page.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add additional LSP info rows to reservation details page.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish interdomain specs.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish redoing AAAS.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>1st quarter 2006</h2>

<p>With I2 and G2,</p>

<ul>
<li>Start implementing inter-domain AAA communication and trust federation,
using mutually agreed upon mechanisms, and messages.</li>
<br/>

<li>Start implementing workflow involved in inter-domain messages for 
reservations.</li>
<br/>
</ul>
