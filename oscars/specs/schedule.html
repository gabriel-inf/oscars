<h1>OSCARS schedule</h1>

<p>This will be converted to some sort of timeline to reduce redundancies
and indicate dependencies.</p>

<h2>10-4 to 10-21</h2> 

<ul>
<li>Replaced use of configuration file with AAAS and BSS database tables.</li>
<li>Met with Mary and Chin about security requirements.  Decided on
workable security implementation, and drew up workflow.</li>
<li>Copied oscars repository to oscars-dev, and private repository to 
oscars-testing.</li>
<li>Moved databases to oscars-testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10-21 to 10-28</h2>

<ul>
<li>Continued security additions to functional and design specifications.</li>
<li>Moved repository and servers to oscars-dev and oscars-testing.</li>
<li>Continued post-installation steps for Apache.</li>
<li>Continued modifying security implementation and workflow through
discussions with Mary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10-31 to 11-6</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decided to have the oscars-dev Web server act as a reverse proxy to 
oscars-test.  Moved OSCARS repository to oscars-test.</li>
<li>Discussed with Mary the usage of SSL in Apache reverse proxy setup,
and writing a module to handle XML Signatures on oscars-test.</li>

<li>Finish security additions to functional and design specifications,
including use of reverse proxy.</li>
<li>Finish post-installation steps for Apache having to do with SSL
and reverse proxy from oscars-dev to oscars-test.  Test SOAP::Lite
dispatching to https URL's.</li>
<li>Get mod_soap working.  Debug AAAS and BSS
servers working with these changes, whether through browser or API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11-7 to 11-13</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish move of repository by figuring out error in accessing
Subversion directories via https (early in week).</li>
<li>Finish debugging AAAS and BSS servers, at which point the OSCARS repository,
CGI scripts, and HTML pages are served off of oscars-test.</li>
<li>Start integration of ROAM material into clients, servers, and database 
schemas.  Start working on ROAM-style resources, attributes, etc.
Strip out current authorization mechanisms.</li>
<li>Work with I2 on integration of BRUW material into OSCARS.</li>
<li>Make the oscars.es.net IP a virtual host
on oscars-dev (which is reverse proxied to the Web server on oscars-test).</li>
<li>John repurposes and readdresses the current oscars.es.net machine.</li>
<li>Mary works on implementing a module for XML signature generation and 
validation (this is not necessarily needed for the inter-domain demo
at the end of November).</li>
</ul>

<h2>11-14 to 11-18</h2>

<ul>
<li>Work on inter-domain specs documents, including workflow, with 
input from I2, GEANT2.</li>
<li>Add forms for user requests for attributes/rights.</li>
<li>Get administrative page to add user and attributes working.</li>
<li>Work with I2 on integrating BRUW material, and on inter-domain 
demo.</li>
<li>Mary helps I2 with setting up server certificate(s) on their machine(s).
</li>
<li> Mary continues working on implementing XML signature generation and 
validation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11-21 to 11-25</h2>
<ul>
<li>Require signed certificates for API access to OSCARS, including access
by another domain's server.</li>
<li>Finish integration of ROAM material.</li>
<li>Have regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs tables
based on SNMP queries (need to integrate BSS/SNMP code).</li>
<li> Mary continues working on implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11-28 to 12-2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Complete inter-domain demo to/from I2.</li>
<li>Save the current page in use in a cookie, and enable the user to
return to an OSCARS page after going someplace else.</li>
<li>Add modify and delete actions (in addition to cancel) on
reservation detail page.  Delete will move the reservation entry to another 
table.</li>
<li>Send notifications on modifications and delete of reservations.</li>
<li>If a user explicitly specifies an egress or ingress router, have an
asterisk after that field in the notification sent to admin users.</li>
<li> Mary completes initial implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation.  Works with I2 if they need assistance in
incorporating it into their version of OSCARS/BRUW.</li>
</ul>

<h2>12-2 to 12-9</h2>

<ul>
<li>Return an error message if a server is not running (currently either
a blank page is returned, or else no action appears to have been taken).</li>
<li>Use mod_perl for CGI scriptsg.</li>
<li>SOAP working with WSDL service description.</li>
<li>Use MySQL 5 views for accesses to db involving oscars user, engr
user, and admin user (replaces some of current functionality.</li>
<li>Have status information flash when the status message changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>12-12 to Christmas break</h2>

<ul>
<li>Purge logs after they get bigger than a specified amount.</li>
<li>Require reservation log to be accessible via reservation detail page
for users with engineering privileges.</li>
<li>Add "recompute route" button" to reservation details page.</li>
<li>Add additional LSP info rows to reservation details page.</li>
<li>Finish redoing AAAS.</li>
<li>Finish interdomain specs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1st quarter 2006</h2>
