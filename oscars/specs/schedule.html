<h1>OSCARS schedule and progress a/o 12-5-2005</h1>

<h2>11-28 to 12-2</h2>

<ul>

<li>Finished move of repository by figuring out error in accessing
Subversion directories via https or http (as opposed to file://)).</li>
<br/>

<li>Met with Chin to discuss OSCARS development.</li>
<br/>

<li>Met with Mary to discuss WSRF-Lite and XML signature handling. </li>
<br/>

<li>Started work on improving OSCARS logging capabilities.</li>
<br/>

<li>Added SOAP calls to add and delete user, and to list all institutions
and user permissions.  The latter two are necessary for the add user form.</li>
<br/>

<li>Added capability to send mailings for multiple actions within a single SOAP
call, for example when there are multiple reservations having LSP configuration
set up or torn down.</li>
<br/>

<li>Fixed several bugs in scheduler, including one relating to the previous
bullet item and multiple reservations being found.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>12-2 to 12-9</h2>

<ul>
<li>Integrate ROAM material into clients, servers, and database schemas.  
Work on ROAM-style resources, attributes, etc.</li>
<br/>

<li>Work with I2 on inter-domain specs documents, integrating BRUW material, 
and develping and testing inter-domain demo.</li>
<br/>

<li>Make service interface as much like JRA5 UNI as possible.</li>
<br/>

<li>Fix bugs in setting user permissions in the add user form.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs tables based on 
SNMP queries (need to integrate BSS/SNMP code).</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish logging improvements.</li>
<br/>

<li> Mary completes initial implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>12-12 to 12-16</h2>

<ul>
<li>SOAP working with WSDL service description.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add forms for user requests for attributes/rights.</li>
<br/>

<li>Move from using mod_perl in a CGI-like way to request handlers.</li>
<br/>

<li>Require reservation log to be accessible via reservation detail page for 
users with engineering privileges.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add "recompute route" button" to reservation details page.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add additional LSP info rows to reservation details page.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish interdomain specs.</li>
<br/>

<br/>
</ul>

<h2>12-19 to Christmas break</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add modify and delete actions (in addition to cancel) on
reservation detail page.  Delete will move the reservation entry to another 
table.</li>
<br/>

<li>Return an error message if a server is not running (currently either
a blank page is returned, or else no action appears to have been taken).</li>
<br/>

<li>Save the current page in use in a cookie, and enable the user to
return to an OSCARS page after going someplace else.</li>
<br/>

<li>Use MySQL 5 views to more cleanly allow access to different fields
in a table, based on user permissions.</li>
<br/>

<li>If a user explicitly specifies an egress or ingress router, have an
asterisk after that field in the notification sent to admin users.</li>
