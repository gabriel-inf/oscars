<h1>OSCARS schedule and progress a/o 11-28-2005</h1>

<p>This will be converted to some sort of timeline to reduce redundancies
and indicate dependencies.</p>

<h2>11-14 to 11-20</h2>

<ul>
<li>Continued debugging WBUI and the AAAS and BSS servers on oscars-test with
the new modifications.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finished security additions to design specification, including use of 
reverse proxy.</li>
<br/>

<li>Moved notification messages and BSS method parameter validation to
AAAS SOAP Dispatcher.  This was done to have all auditing and validation in one
place, to make it easier to have a chain of request handlers in one
place.  This will make it easier to add additional request handlers in
the Dispatcher, such as the one to validate XML Signature, or any handlers for
BRUW-specific AAA material.</li>
<br/>

<li>Used mod_perl instead of CGI scripts, completely refactoring the previous 
scripts into an object oriented version.  Read large amount of 
mod_perl material in the process.  Using mod_perl brings in a large amount of
functionality for free.</li>
<br/>

<li>Reworked authorization mechanisms in preparation for moving
to ROAM authorization service.</li>
<br/>

<li>Started work on regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs tables
based on SNMP queries (need to integrate BSS/SNMP code).</li>
<br/>

<li>Mary continued working on implementing XML signature generation and 
validation.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>11-21 to 11-23</h2>
<ul>

<li>Continued work on regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs tables
based on SNMP queries (need to integrate BSS/SNMP code).</li>
<br/>

<li>Finished working on httpd configuration files for oscars-dev and
oscars-test for new setup.  Got reverse proxying from oscars-dev to 
oscars-test working with firewall filter help from John Webster.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finished debugging WBUI and the AAAS and BSS servers on oscars-test with the
new modifications, finishing the migration process from the old oscars.es.net 
machine (except for Subversion).</li>
<br/>

<li>Wrote framework for sending notifications based on SOAP method name.</li>
<br/>

<li> Mary continued working on implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation, to be able to require signed certificates for API 
access to OSCARS, including access by another domain's server.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>11-28 to 12-2</h2>

<ul>

<li>Finish move of repository by figuring out error in accessing
Subversion directories via https or http (as opposed to file://)).
May require upgrading to FreeBSD 6.0.</li>
<br/>

<li>Make the oscars.es.net IP a virtual host on oscars-dev (which is 
reverse proxied to the Web server on oscars-test).  Old machine will be
readdressed.</li>
<br/>

<li>Integrate ROAM material into clients, servers, and database 
schemas.  Start working on ROAM-style resources, attributes, etc.</li>
<br/>

<li>Work on inter-domain specs documents, including workflow, with 
input from I2, GEANT2.</li>
<br/>

<li>Work with I2 on integrating BRUW material, and on inter-domain 
demo.</li>
<br/>

<li>Get administrative page to add user and attributes working.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs tables
based on SNMP queries (need to integrate BSS/SNMP code).</li>
<br/>

<li> Mary completes initial implementation  of module for XML signature 
generation and validation.  Works with I2 if they need assistance in
incorporating it into their version of OSCARS/BRUW.</li>
<br/>

</ul>

<h2>12-2 to 12-9</h2>

<ul>

<li>Move from using mod_perl in a CGI-like way to request handlers.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add forms for user requests for attributes/rights.</li>
<br/>

<li>Test the inter-domain demo to/from I2.</li>
<br/>

<li>Save the current page in use in a cookie, and enable the user to
return to an OSCARS page after going someplace else.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add modify and delete actions (in addition to cancel) on
reservation detail page.  Delete will move the reservation entry to another 
table.</li>
<br/>

<li>Return an error message if a server is not running (currently either
a blank page is returned, or else no action appears to have been taken).</li>
<br/>

<li>If a user explicitly specifies an egress or ingress router, have an
asterisk after that field in the notification sent to admin users.</li>
<br/>

<li>SOAP working with WSDL service description.</li>
<br/>

<li>Have status information flash when the status message changes.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>12-12 to Christmas break</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use MySQL 5 views to more cleanly allow access to different fields
in a table, based on user permissions.</li>
<br/>

<li>Purge logs after they get bigger than a specified amount.</li>
<br/>

<li>Require reservation log to be accessible via reservation detail page
for users with engineering privileges.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add "recompute route" button" to reservation details page.</li>
<br/>

<li>Add additional LSP info rows to reservation details page.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish interdomain specs.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish redoing AAAS.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>1st quarter 2006</h2>

<p>With I2 and G2,</p>

<ul>
<li>Start implementing inter-domain AAA communication and trust federation,
using mutually agreed upon mechanisms, and messages.</li>
<br/>

<li>Start implementing workflow involved in inter-domain messages for 
reservations.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>2nd and 3rd quarter, 2006</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish implementing inter-domain AAA communication and trust 
federation.</li>
<br/>

<li>Finish implementing inter-domain messages for reservations.</li>
<br/>
</ul>

<h2>4th quarter 2006</h2>

<ul>
<li>Incorporate monitoring within OSCARS.</li>
<br/>

<li>Have demo of the work that has been completed.</li>
<br/>
</ul>
