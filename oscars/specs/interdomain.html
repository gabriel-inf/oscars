<h2>Interdomain Reservation Protocol Functional Specification</h2>

<h3>DRAFT</h3>

September 12, 2005<br/>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>To develop the capability for the reservation managers of various 
administrative domains to communicate and stitch together paths
for high bandwidth reservations traversing multiple domains.

<a id="nni">
<h2>Network to network interface</h2>

There must be a standards-based interface for the reservation managers
of different domains to communicate reservation requests.

<a id="interop">
<h2>Interoperability and trust federation</h2>

<p>A reservation manager from one domain  must be able to interoperate with the 
reservation managers of other autonomous domains.  High-bandwidth reservations 
will be needed, for example by 
<a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/">LHC</a> 
users, that traverse multiple domains.</p>

<p>An AAA must have mechanisms for trusting other
domains.  It must forward necessary certificates or tokens to the AAA's of 
other domains to authenticate a client, and assertions to authorize a
client to use a domain's
reservation.  An AAA must interoperate with another trusted AAA, even
if that system uses a different means of authentication or authorization .</p>
