Notes from meeting with Bob and Maarten

Common description language (for advertising service to other domains)
UNI v2

1. Ethernet

2. uncompressed DSTREAM

3. lightpath

4. layer 2 (Sonet XDH)

5. Dragon

Chin suggested that since both GEANT2 and I2 have layer 3 implementations,
can focus on management, inter-domain issues.

Bob suggested that by the 15th, each of us send in a short list of 6 to 8
items of things to talk about and find consensus, for the agenda.  Tom
Lehman will be attending.

Chin would like an informal roadmap to come out of the meeting, a timeline
of collaboration between ESnet, GEANT2, and I2.

The meeting on the 15th will last most of the day, starting around 9.

variables

    Shibboleth via GridShib

    MyProxy or FusionGrid to store certs in a central location, where
    revocation is esaier.

    Assertions about users are in SAML format.  How much of
    Shibboleth to use as is (but requires complex installation, probably)

AAAS

    Front end, db access still in Perl?

    or

    Separate out authentication component (use SAML, SAOP) into
    Java component?

    How do various packages do SSO, rather than CGI::Session, which
    should be replaced.

    User privilege levels whould be replaced with SAML assertions?  All
    possible users are not going to have OSCARS accounts (inter-domain
    especially).  Admins and engrs will still have db accounts.
    assertions for Web forms?

timeline

    SOAP over SSL

    SAML over SSL
        with auth cert
        with authorization assertions

specs

    need functional spec for peering, both of scheduling and signalling

    need timeline
