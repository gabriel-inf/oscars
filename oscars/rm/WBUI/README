Almost through incorporating BRUW forms.

Copy material in html into:

    /usr/local/esnet/virtual-sites/oscars.es.net/web/

Copy material in cgi into:

    /usr/local/esnet/virtual-sites/oscars.es.net/cgi-bin/

Copy htaccess to .htaccess in

    /usr/local/esnet/virtual-sites/oscars.es.net/cgi-bin/users and
    /usr/local/esnet/virtual-sites/oscars.es.net/cgi-bin/admin

Allow Override FileInfo must be set in your Apache httpd.conf for you to
be able to use the material in .htaccess
