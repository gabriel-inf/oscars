Self test suite for OSCARS, adapted from the libwww-perl self test suite

Last updated:  May 25, 2006

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script.  You can also run all tests 
with "make test" at the top OSCARS directory, if you are logged in as the 
oscars user, or have your ssh config set up correctly.

You might run an individual test like this:

  ./TEST -v oscars/01_database.t

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST oscars

Test log output is written to test.log in this directory.


The oscars sub-directory contains tests for many OSCARS classes and all SOAP 
methods.  They can be run by any user.

The TestManager class provides common functionality for all SOAP method tests.
params.xml contains parameter configuration for the SOAP method tests.

topology contains tests of classes handling traceroutes and SNMP.  The tests 
must be run by the oscars user.

pss contains tests of the PSS component of OSCARS.  They must be run by the
oscars user.

interop contains SOAP interoperability tests.  Currently it only contains tests 
for the pyGridWare client.

interdomain will contain tests for interdomain circuit setup, for example with
I2.
