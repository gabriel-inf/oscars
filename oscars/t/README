Self test suite for OSCARS, adapted from the libwww-perl self test suite
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script, but usually you run
the tests with "make test" at the top OSCARS directory.  Use -v
option for verbose tests.  You might run an individual test like this:

  ./TEST -v aaas/01_login

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST aaas
