  A) Path Discovery 

There are two scenarios for creating a path in OSCARS.  One is where the
reservation originates within the OSCARS system.  The other is where a request
is forwarded from another reservation system, 

In the first case where the reservation originates within the OSCAR system,
OSCARS does a trace towards the source IP address of the traffic. As the trace
progress across the routers in the OSCARS system, each router it checked to make
sure that it is controlled by OSCARS. As soon as OSCARS encounters a router that
is outside of the system, OSCARS marks that router as the ingress router. After
the ingress router is located, OSCARS acts the same as if it had received a
request that contained the ingress router already (explained below).

In the second case another reservation system contacts OSCARS and asks it to
create a path from a particular ingress router towards a destination IP address.
In this case OSCARS starts at the ingress router and 'traces' a path towards the
destination address. As each router is traversed it is checked to see if it is
contained within the OSCARS system. As soon as a router is encountered in the
path that is outside of OSCARS control, that router is checked against a list of
AS (Autonomous System) numbers that OSCARS knows how to communicate with. If the
router is in that list, OSCARS will forward the request on to that system, so
that that system can continue to trace the path. If the last router does not
belong to another system that OSCARS knows how to communicate with, OSCARS marks
that that as the egress router and establishes the LSP between the ingress and
egress routers.
