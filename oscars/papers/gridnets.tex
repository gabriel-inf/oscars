\begin{abstract}
With the advent of service sensitive applications (such as remote controlled 
experiments, time constrained massive data transfers, video-conferencing, etc.),
it has become apparent that there is a need for the setup of dynamically 
provisioned, quality of service enabled circuits.
The On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System (OSCARS) is 
a prototype service enabling on-demand provisioning of guaranteed bandwidth 
secure circuits.

OSCARS operates within the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet), and has
provisions for interoperation with other network domains.
ESnet is a high-speed network serving thousands 
of Department of Energy scientists and collaborators worldwide.

OSCARS utilizes the Web services model and standards to implement communication
with the system and between domains, and for authentication, authorization,
and auditing (AAA).  The management and operation of end-to-end circuits 
within the network is done at the layer 3 level.  Label Switched Paths 
(LSP's) are used, implemented using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and 
the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). Quality of Service (QoS) is used to 
provide bandwidth guarantees.

\section{Introduction}
Large-scale science is increasingly important as attention turns to the
study of the most complex, subtle, and elusive natural phenomena.  Such
study is completely dependent on world-wide collaborations of scientists
and widely dispersed resources such as computing, data, and instruments.

Over the past several years significant improvements have been made in the
computing and communications infrastructure necessary for support of these
collaborations.  Network bandwidths have increased, data transport protocols
have improved, and security issues have become better understood.  However,
for the network to fully enable such distributed science, network
communication must be delivered as a manageable service to the distributed
applications just as computing is.

The goal of OSCARS is to manage and schedule high-impact network services
associated with these collaborations.  These services, which move 
multi-terabyte to multi-petabyte datasets from experiments and simulations,
and which include high-end remote visualizations, cannot be provided 
cost-effectively by the production network.  In this context, services must 
be \emph{deterministic}, implying a defined and guaranteed service level.
At a minimum, bandwidth must be guaranteed, and possibly the ability to 
specify loss rates, latency, jitter, and other parameters in the future.

OSCARS has been developed within ESnet,
which is a nation wide network that serves approximately 42 directly connected 
sites around the country.  Internally, ESnet manages about 270 routers and 
systems throughout the network and its operations centers.  The current ESnet 
architecture (Figure 1) is that of a high-bandwidth (10/2.5 Gb/s) backbone ring 
around the country, with hubs at strategic locations.  The end sites are 
connected to the hubs in a spoke-like fashion, with local loops and last-mile 
tail circuits that are typically 0.6 or 2.5 Gb/s for the big science 
laboratories.  OSCARS faces the constraint of operation within this production 
network, where 99.9+\% reliability is critical.

Having the ability to dynamically allocate capacity in the network exclusively 
to a scheduled service, to the exclusion of normal priority traffic, introduces 
risks.
Throughout the design and implementation of OSCARS, security aspects were
paramount.  The impact of an abuse could be very
large.  A DoS attack could prevent reservations from being processed.  If the
service is compromised, and thus the routers it has access to, the wide
area network may be disabled.

The following sections cover how OSCARS addresses the above constraints and
risks while implementing a scheduling system.  Section II covers the 
OSCARS system, and Section III describes the details of
path setup and reservation handling.

OSCARS will only be useful if it is one element in a series of possibly
heterogeneous reservation systems setting up a complete end-to-end circuit.
The section on interdomain reservations covers other reservation systems and 
collaborations that have been set up with their developers, as well as 
interoperability tests that have been performed thus far.

Section V covers security, including system, interdomain, and AAA issues.
The final section touches briefly on the future work that needs to be performed
to handle a dynamically changing network (which may invalidate existing
reservations), and to set up end-to-end circuits between domains
in a secure, standards-based fashion.

\section{System}

The intent of OSCARS is to create a service for dynamic QoS path establishment
that is simple for users to use, and easy to administer.  The only task 
required of a user is to make a bandwidth reservation.  The user does not have 
to configure an alternate routing path, nor mark the packets in any way.  All 
necessary mechanisms needed to provide the user with a guaranteed bandwidth 
path are coordinated by a reservation manager (RM) and managed by the routers 
in the network.

\subsection{Components}

The RM is comprised of three components:  the 
Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing Subsystem (AAAS), the Bandwidth 
Scheduler Subsystem (BSS), and the Path Setup Subsystem (PSS).
All persistent information is stored in a database.  Administration of
the RM is done through simple Web forms.

The AAAS is responsible for authenticating and authorizing all external 
requests, for logging request information, and sending notifications to
users and administrators of the results of calls made to the RM.  It also
handles a number of internal requests related to its management.

The BSS is responsible for scheduling reservations.  It handles
requests to schedule bandwidth reservation, list a reservation's details,
modify and/or cancel one or more existing reservations, and provide a summary
of all current reservations.

To perform these functions, the BSS keeps information about past,
pending, and current reservations, and tracks the current topology and state of
the network.  As part of scheduling a requested reservation, the BSS must
determine whether the requested bandwidth will over-utilize any of the links
in the path to be set up within the network.

The PSS is responsible for setting up and tearing down the on-demand bandwidth 
paths. This is accomplished by making the necessary configuration changes in 
the routers to create or destroy a Label Switched Path (LSP) at the time
indicated by the BSS. The authentication and authorization method for the PSS 
is internal to the ESnet network and is specific to the router platform 
(currently Juniper or Cisco) being configured.  It is therefore distinct from 
the AAA used by the BSS.

\subsection{Implementation (David)}

Web services standards are used wherever possible, including SOAP
for communicating between a client and the RM, and WSDL for the service
description. 
 
The resource manager is implemented as an Apache Web server configured for
mod\_perl, a SOAP server, two databases within a MySQL server, and a set of 
Perl packages that implement the AAAS, BSS, and PSS.  The Web server is
used to accept CGI requests, and to forward API requests directly to the SOAP 
server.  CGI requests are reformatted as SOAP requests, and then forwarded to 
the SOAP server.  One database contains persistent information related to
reservations and AAA, and the other contains a representation of the local
network topology.  Security issues are discussed in the section on security
below.

\section{Paths and Reservations}

\subsection{Path Setup}

The procedure of a typical path setup is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
A user submits a request to the RM (using either an API or
an optional web front-end) to schedule an end-to-end path (e.g. between an
experiment and computing cluster) specifying start and end times, bandwidth
requirements, and specific source IP address and port that will be used to     
provide application access to the path.

\item
This information is stored by the BSS in a database, and a script 
periodically checks to see if the PSS needs to be contacted, either to create 
or tear down the circuit.

\item
At the requested start time, the PSS configures the ESnet router
(at the start end of the path) to create an LSP with the
specified bandwidth.

\item
Each router along the route receives the path setup request (via RSVP)
and commits bandwidth (if available) creating an end-to-end LSP.  The RM is
notified by RSVP if the end-to-end path cannot be established.  The RM
passes this notification bak to the user.

\item
Packets from the source (e.g. experiment) are routed through the
LAN's production path to ESnet's edge router.  On entering the edge router,
these packets are identified and filtered using flow specification parameters
(e.g. source/destination IP address/port numbers) and policed at the specified
bandwidth.  The packets are then injected into the LSP and switched (using MPLS)
through the network to its destination (e.g. computing cluster).

\item
A notification of the success or failure of LSP setup is 
passed back to the RM so that the user can be notified and the event 
logged for auditing purposes.

\item
At the requested end time, the PSS tears down the LSP.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Path Discovery}
There are two scenarios for creating a path in OSCARS.  One is where the
reservation originates within the OSCARS system.  The other is where a request
is forwarded from another reservation system. 

In the first case where the reservation originates within the OSCAR system,
OSCARS does a trace towards the source IP address of the traffic. As the trace
progress across the routers in the OSCARS system, each router it checked to make
sure that it is controlled by OSCARS. As soon as OSCARS encounters a router that
is outside of the system, OSCARS marks that router as the ingress router. After
the ingress router is located, OSCARS acts the same as if it had received a
request that contained the ingress router already (explained below).

In the second case another reservation system contacts OSCARS and asks it to
create a path from a particular ingress router towards a destination IP address.
In this case OSCARS starts at the ingress router and 'traces' a path towards the
destination address. As each router is traversed it is checked to see if it is
contained within the OSCARS system. As soon as a router is encountered in the
path that is outside of OSCARS control, that router is checked against a list of
AS (Autonomous System) numbers that OSCARS knows how to communicate with. If the
router is in that list, OSCARS will forward the request on to that system, so
that that system can continue to trace the path. If the last router does not
belong to another system that OSCARS knows how to communicate with, OSCARS marks
that that as the egress router and establishes the LSP between the ingress and
egress routers.

\subsection{Advanced Reservations (Jason)}
In OSCARS advance reservations are handled in a slot based manner. This equates
to 'first come first served' for bandwidth across any particular link at any
moment. As each reservation is requested in OSCARS, the end-to-end path is
computed for that reservation. Once the entire path though all the routers
controlled by OSCARS has been computed then each link in the path is checked for
available bandwidth. To check the bandwidth of a link all outstanding
reservations for that link during the time of the proposed reservation are
queried from the data base. Then all the reserved bandwidth amounts are
calculated and compared to the the actual capacity of the link. If the requested
amount of bandwidth plus all outstanding reservations is more then the allocated
amount of bandwidth available for reservations on that link (usually
50\%), then the reservation fails. Only if there is enough bandwidth 
available on all links is the reservation committed into the reservation system.

In the case where the capacity of a link changes, all outstanding reservations
that involve the use of that link are queried from the system and recomputed.
This is done to ensure that at the time that the reservation is 'setup' there
is adequate bandwidth available on that link for the reservation.

\subsection{Provisioning and Policing (Chin)}
To facilitate bandwidth guarantees, provisioning and policing are needed to 
enforce reservation and usage limits.  In OSCARS, RSVP is used as the 
provisioning mechanism.  To ensure that resources are not over-subscribed, QoS 
is carefully configured to provision queues within the network core.  Within 
ESnet, traffic utilizing the OSCARS service is classified into a distinct 
Class-of-Service from all other traffic and isolated into a separate queue by 
itself.  The size of this queue is configured to match the RSVP bandwidth 
limits on each interface, e.g. if the RSVP bandwidth limit on an interface is 
50\%, the "OSCARS" queue is also set at 50\%.  This ensures that the RSVP 
provisioned bandwidth will translate to available network bandwidth within 
the core.

With all of OSCARS traffic using the same Class-of-Service queue within the 
core, it is vital to ensure that the bandwidth usage of each corresponding 
RSVP reservation is strictly adhered to.  This prevents the aggregate traffic 
from overrunning the queue dedicated to the OSCARS service.  To do this, each 
flow utilizing the OSCARS service is policed individually according to the 
reservation bandwidth request.  This policing is done at the ingress point to 
ESnet.


\section{Interdomain Reservations}

Analogous to QoS guarantees, guaranteed bandwidth paths are most effective 
when the reservation spans end-to-end.  This however, introduces the 
complexity of extending guaranteed bandwidth paths beyond the scope of a 
single administrative domain to multiple domains.  To facilitate this, 
neighboring domains must agree on several levels, mainly the management plan, 
control plan, and data plan:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The management plane dictates policies and procedures, authentication, 
authorization, and usage.  This essentially amounts to a Service Level 
Agreement (SLA) between peer networks.

\item
The control plane dictates the way control messages, such as setup and 
teardown requests, are exchanged between the networks, e.g. RSVP signaling.

\item
The data plane handles how user traffic is forwarded from one network to 
another network, e.g. IP packets, Ethernet VLAN packets, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Similar Work}

Today, there are several implementations of network resource management and
service provisioning systems in existence.  These include the DOE funded
TeraPaths and USN projects, the NSF funded CHEETAH and DRAGON projects,
Internet2's BRUW and HOPI projects,  CANARIE's UCLPv2 project, and GEANT's
BoD (JRA3) and AMPS (SA3) activities.

All of these projects, as well as OSCARS, are based on a Web services 
interface to reserve and configure a path across the network. However, they 
have slightly different ways of handling reservations and AAA issues.

Dragon uses  OSPF-TE [REF] for intradomain routing, and a component called
the Network Aware Resource Broker (NARB) for interdomain routing.
Dragon plans to use the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) [REF]
protocol for support of policy provisioning (COPS-PR) [REF].

Canarie, Canada's advanced Internet development organization, has been
working on a project called User Controlled LightPath (UCLP).  UCLP
allows end-users to create their own independent IP network as a subset
of a larger optical network and to have a total control over their share
of network.

The University of Amsterdam's Advanced Internet Research group has
published a number of papers
describing both the networking and the AAA issues for such a system,
including [REF][REF][REF]. They are using the IETF AAA Framework
[rfc2905], and use XACML to describe policy. They have also defined a
"Network Description Language" (NDL), which is a RDF-based method to
describe networks, to facilitate interdomain interoperability.

With the exception of OSCARS, BRUW,
TeraPaths, and AMPS, all other projects mentioned above provision resources
in the optical network layer (i.e. layer 1), creating lightpaths.
With the OSCARS, BRUW, TeraPaths, and AMPS projects, IP connectivity (layer
3) is used as the data plane exchange.  This facilitates interoperability
trials as no additional network connection is needed outside of the production
peering exchange.

\subsection{Interdomain Path Setup (Jason)}
One of the more complex examples of using the OSCARS reservation system involves
setting up a path between two hosts when the path between the hosts spans
several different Autonomous Systems (AS's) For example, imagine a setting up a
path between Host A and Host B, where Host A is controlled by remote reservation
system and Host B is part of the local OSCARS reservation system.  To accomplish
this, a "Forward Create" message has to be sent across the network towards Host
A, crossing all intervening reservations systems, until it reaches the last
reservation system that is controlling the network that Host A is attached to.
At that point the remote reservation system has to initiate the creation of the
path from Host A towards Host B.  This can be especially complex when the path
back is asymmetric and traverses AS's that were not traversed on the forward
path, causing the local OSCARS to see the path originating from a different 
AS then it originally sent the "Create" request out to. This forced us
to come up with a efficient and heterogeneous WSDL that describes the various
messages that can be passed between the Reservation Systems. This allows
each Reservation System to communicate with other Reservation Systems in 
well defined and general format. It is then up to the individual system to 
transform the various messages to internal calls to reserve the path.

\subsection{Interoperability Tests:  (Chin/Jason)}

On Apr 6, 2006, an inter-domain guaranteed bandwidth path between Abilene and 
ESnet was dynamically negotiated and configured by the BRUW and OSCARS systems 
respectively. The unidirectional 25Mb/s guaranteed bandwidth path was 
configured between an Internet2 test host in Indianapolis, IN and an ESnet 
Performance Center [REF] host in Sunnyvale, CA.  The path consisted of two 
unidirectional MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP's), one in Abilene, and the 
other in ESnet, "stitched" together at the Abilene-ESnet peering point in 
Chicago, IL.

Bandwidth tests using IPerf (see Table ~\ref{tab:bandwidth}) revealed predictable results except for the guaranteed bandwidth TCP transfer.

<Table to be inserted from Word document>

The guaranteed bandwidth (25Mb/s) TCP transfer should have yielded a 
throughput closer to 25Mb/s.  On further investigation, it was determined 
that the 
discrepancy between the policing bandwidth and the achieved bandwidth was 
likely the result of two things, first, the lack of traffic shaping at the 
source end, and second, Juniper's policing function.  Similar results have 
been documented by others [REF].


\section{Security}
A goal in implementation was to make security mechanisms as easy to install
use, and administer as possible, as long as security is not compromised.

The following section details steps taken to secure the machines and 
servers running OSCARS, and the remaining security sections cover AAA.

\subsection{System (David)}

An Apache2 Web server on an open ESnet machine is used to forward all 
requests to the RM Web server, which runs on a machine behind a firewall. 
This forwarding process is transparent to the end user, and hides the location 
of the internal server.

The internal Web server only accept https connections from the open machine.
The RM SOAP server only accepts requests from clients on the internal machine. 
Database server processes run as an unprivileged user without a login 
shell.  The database server only accepts requests from the SOAP server.


\subsection{Authentication}
OSCARS authenticates the creation and management of
reservations. The web based interface and the SOAP server API use the
authentication mechanism that is most natural for them. The web server
requires a username and password for authentication on the first
access during which it creates session information for the user and a
8-hour cookie referencing this information to be used on subsequent
connections. All communication with the web server takes place over
encrypted https in order to protect against the stealing of passwords
or cookies. The SOAP API requires digitally signed messages [digSig]
and verifies the signature and the signing certificate to authenticate
the user. It then uses the subject name from the signing certificate
to identify the user. Both mechanisms use the database user table to
determine if the request is coming from a legitimate user. This table
contains a mapping of the OSCARS user name, password, subject name
from the certificate and the certificate itself, as well as other
information about the user.

Requests for or about interdomain
reservations are authenticated in the originating domain on the basis
of an individual user, and in the subsequent domains on the basis of
the reservation server in the adjacent domain. Normally all requests
between domains will be a SOAP "forward" operation and be in messages
signed by the reservation server. Each domain has a list of the
co-operating domain server certificates as well as a list of
permissions for that domain. In effect a service level agreement gets
implemented in the users and authorization databases. The forward
message includes the name of the originating user, in case other
domains wish to use that information for authorization. Currently, at
the time of provisioning no further authentication is
done. Provisioning is triggered by the time of the reservation. Once
the provisioning has been completed, any traffic coming from the
specified ingress router is able to use the higher class of bandwidth.

\subsection{Authorization}
Once a request has been authenticated as from a registered OSCARS
users, that user's authorization is checked against an authorization
table in the database. This implementation was inspired by one of the
author's experience with the ROAM authorization service of the
FusionGrid [ROAM]. This approach allows the use of standard database
commands to define resources and permissions and to manage and check
authorizations. As long as there are not too many resources,
permissions or users, it provides simple to manage and understand
access control. In the case of OSCARS, we control access to the
classes of reservations, users and domains. The permissions that can
be granted are view, manage(modify), maximum-bandwidth for a
reservation, duration of a reservation and the right to specify
routing.  We anticipate that the total number of authorized users will
be no greater than 50, remembering that OSCARS only needs to know
about users at ESnet sites who have the rights to schedule
high-bandwidth service and co-operating reservation servers in other
domains. If the users grow beyond this point, the tables can be
expanded to define groups (roles, or projects) of users.

\subsection{Auditing}
At this point, the OSCARS server logs all significant activity such as
creating or canceling reservations. In addition a list of all
reservations is kept and can be read with the listReservations
operation. As was mentioned above, in interdomain requests, the name
of the originating user is passed to the next domain where it can be
used for either authorization or auditing.


\section{Future Work}
\subsection{Topology Changes -- dynamic update of the reservations table. (Jason)}

\subsection{Recovery From Network Changes}
A key consideration when running OSCARS as a production service, is the
ability to recover from both scheduled and unscheduled network outages or
changes.  This is particularly complex when dealing with bandwidth
reservations made for a future date.  For example, in the event of an
unscheduled network outage, future reservations committed on the affected
links must be recalculated. This can be further complicated if the outage
period is unknown.  The converse is also true.  If a new link were to be
added or upgraded, increasing the bandwidth allocation for future
reservations creates an inconsistent view with the current state of the
network.

\subsection{Future standards work (Chin)}
With the objective of interoperability between the different networks,
comes the need for defining standard interfaces (i.e. Network-to-Network
Interface (NNI)).  This is to facilitate the sharing of network state and
request information in quanitfiable characteristics that are common to
collaborting networks.  This could include properties such as connectivity
(topology), bandwidth, latency, and jitter.  There are several documents
that have been published by the different projects as well as organizations
related to this work [Ref JRA3,NDL,UCLP,IETF CCAMP]. However due to the
heterogenity of network implementations and deployments, generate a single
framework to quantify all networks is not trivial.
