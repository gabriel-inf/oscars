%\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format
                        % of the cite.sty package \cite{} output to follow
                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

                        % at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
% NOTE: for dual use with latex and pdflatex, instead load graphicx like:
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage{graphicx}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
%\fi

% However, be warned that pdflatex will require graphics to be in PDF
% (not EPS) format and will preclude the use of PostScript based LaTeX
% packages such as psfrag.sty and pstricks.sty. IEEE conferences typically
% allow PDF graphics (and hence pdfLaTeX). However, IEEE journals do not
% (yet) allow image formats other than EPS or TIFF. Therefore, authors of
% journal papers should use traditional LaTeX with EPS graphics.
%
% The path(s) to the graphics files can also be declared: e.g.,
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}{../ps/}}
% if the graphics files are not located in the same directory as the
% .tex file. This can be done in each branch of the conditional above
% (after graphicx is loaded) to handle the EPS and PDF cases separately.
% In this way, full path information will not have to be specified in
% each \includegraphics command.
%
% Note that, when switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the new
% compiler will have to be run twice to clear some warnings.

                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and

%\usepackage{amsmath}   % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands

                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks

                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools, especially mdwmath.sty and
% mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations and tables, respectively.
% The MDWtools set is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The lastest
% version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools/


% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.


% Also of notable interest:

% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/



% Notes on hyperref:
% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b 
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
%\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
The Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) 
is a high-speed network serving thousands of Department of Energy scientists 
and collaborators worldwide.
With the advent of service sensitive applications (such as remote controlled 
experiments, time constrained massive data transfers, video-conferencing, etc.),
it has become apparent that there is a need to augment the services present in
today's ESnet infrastructure.  In particular, there is a need for dynamically 
provisioned, quality of service enabled paths.

The ESnet On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation 
System (OSCARS) is  a prototype service enabling
on-demand provisioning of guaranteed bandwidth secure circuits both within 
ESnet, and across network domains.

OSCARS utilizes the Web services model and standards to implement communication
with the system and between domains, and for authentication, authorization,
and auditing (AAA).  The management and operation of end-to-end circuits 
within the network is done at the layer 3 level.  Label Switched Paths 
(LSP's) are used, implemented using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and 
the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). Quality of Service (QoS) is used to 
provide bandwidth guarantees.

\section{Issues dealt with}
\subsection{Path Discovery}
There are two scenarios for creating a path in OSCARS.  One is where the
reservation originates within the OSCARS system.  The other is where a request
is forwarded from another reservation system, 

In the first case where the reservation originates within the OSCAR system,
OSCARS does a trace towards the source IP address of the traffic. As the trace
progress across the routers in the OSCARS system, each router it checked to make
sure that it is controlled by OSCARS. As soon as OSCARS encounters a router that
is outside of the system, OSCARS marks that router as the ingress router. After
the ingress router is located, OSCARS acts the same as if it had received a
request that contained the ingress router already (explained below).

In the second case another reservation system contacts OSCARS and asks it to
create a path from a particular ingress router towards a destination IP address.
In this case OSCARS starts at the ingress router and 'traces' a path towards the
destination address. As each router is traversed it is checked to see if it is
contained within the OSCARS system. As soon as a router is encountered in the
path that is outside of OSCARS control, that router is checked against a list of
AS (Autonomous System) numbers that OSCARS knows how to communicate with. If the
router is in that list, OSCARS will forward the request on to that system, so
that that system can continue to trace the path. If the last router does not
belong to another system that OSCARS knows how to communicate with, OSCARS marks
that that as the egress router and establishes the LSP between the ingress and
egress routers.
