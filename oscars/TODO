Feature enhancements


Upgrade to MySQL 5, have views associated with oscars user and admin user.

Use mod_perl.

Purge logs after they get bigger than a specified amount.

Have regular updates to routers, interfaces, and ipaddrs table based on SNMP
queries (need to integrate use of existing SNMP code).

Return an error message if a server is not running (currently either a blank
page is returned, or else no action appears to have been taken).

Have status information flash when the status message changes.

Reintegrate Shibboleth material from BRUW.

Get "add user" form working.

Save the current page in use in a cookie, and enable the user to return to
an OSCARS page after going somewhere else.

Require certificates for DOE user access to OSCARS.


Reservations detail page:
    Make reservation log accessible via this page for engineering users.

    Add modify and delete actions (in addition to cancel).  Delete will
    move the reservation entry to another table.

    Add "recompute" route button.

    Add additional LSP info rows.

Notifications:
    If a user explicitly specifies an egress or ingress router, have an
    asterisk after that field in the notification sent to the admin users.

    Send notifications on modifications and deletion of reservations.
