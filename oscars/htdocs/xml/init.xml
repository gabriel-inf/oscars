<div class="info">
<p>With the advent of service sensitive applications (such as remote-
controlled experiments, time constrained massive data transfers,
video-conferencing, etc.), it has become apparent that there is a need
to augment the services present in today's ESnet infrastructure.</p>

<p>Two DOE Office of Science workshops in the past two years have clearly 
identified both science discipline driven network requirements and a 
roadmap for meeting these requirements.  This project begins to 
address one element of the roadmap: dynamically provisioned, QoS paths.</p>

<p>The focus of the ESnet On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation 
System (OSCARS) is to develop and deploy a prototype service that enables 
on-demand provisioning of guaranteed bandwidth secure circuits within ESnet.</p>

<h3>OSCARS Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chin Guok
is the principal investigator and network engineer.</li>

<li>David Robertson
is the main developer of the reservation manager component, and of
corresponding Perl clients and tests and Web interfaces.</li>

<li>Mary Thompson
is handling security and the service description, including interoperability
issues.</li>

<li>Jason Lee
is working on network issues and Java clients, including the use of 
signing.</li>

<li>Brian Tierney
is working on network issues, including performance testing.</li>
