Installation:
-------------
1. Create the required mysql table with teh following command
    mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME -p bss < sql/createTables.sql
2. Set you MySQL username and password in "cgi-bin/conf/config.yaml". 
   Change the "db_user" and db_pass" to a MySQL username and password 
   respectively. The username should have read access to the "bss" table.
3. Change the MySQL username and password in "utils/runReport.pl" by 
   replacing MYUSER and MYPASS in the following lines:
    my $DB_USER = "MYUSER";
    my $DB_PASS = "MYPASS";
   This account must have read and write permissions on the "bss table". 
   It may be the same as in step 2 if the account has write permissions. 
4. Add run "utils/runReport.pl" to the crontab by running "crontab -e". This script will periodically
   compile the stats displayed on the graph. To have it compile these stats every 30 minutes tadd the following to crontab:
        0,30 * * * * perl $OSCARS_HOME/tools/statistics/utils/runReport.pl
5. Decompress the dojo library under "html/lib/dojo-release-1.3.1.tar.gz":
    cd html/lib/
    gunzip dojo-release-1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -xvf dojo-release-1.3.1.tar
5. Copy the contents of html/stats to a subdirectory under apache. For example:
    cp -r html/stats /var/www/html/stats 
6. Copy the contents of cgi-bin to a subdirectory under apache. For example:
    cp -r cgi-bin/* /var/www/cgi-bin 
7. You should now be able to visit the page using your browser. For example:
    Open browser to http://yourdomain.net/stats
