LogRotate4OSCARS v 1.0 - June 25, 2009
================================================

-------------
Description:
-------------
The scripts in this directory use the UNIX logrotate utility 
to manage the OSCARS logs. They compress and delete the logs
over time. You will need to edit the configuration and edit
crontab to use these scripts.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------
- OSCARS
- logrotate

-------------
Installation:
-------------
1. Open logrotate4oscars.conf. Change the paths to match your installation. 
   If $OSCARS_HOME is set to "/usr/local/oscars" and $CATALINA_HOME is set to 
   /usr/local/tomcat" then no changes are required.
   
2. Copy logrotate4oscars.conf to /usr/local/etc:
    sudo cp logrotate4oscars.conf /usr/local/etc
    
3. Run 'crontab -e' as root and add the following (NOTE: change /usr/local/oscars 
   to the location of OSCARS on your filesystem):
    0 0 * * * /usr/local/oscars/tools/logrotate/logrotate4oscars
