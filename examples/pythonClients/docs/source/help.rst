Getting help
############

There are times when you really need to get ahold of the programmer, maybe
because you found a nasty bug.

Be it for the command line interface, or the API, I'm available to help.

How do I contact you?
*********************

Your best bet would be to e-mail me.
I usually read my e-mail several times a day, but do not always have the time
to write down comprehensive reply, so you might need to wait a little, for
example if I need to do some testing on my own.

Where can I find your e-mail address?
*************************************

The e-mail address I am using at any given point in time is listed on my
`Web site <http://campanel.la/>`_. You can also find my GPG public key there
(as well as on public key servers), should you need to send me something
securely.
